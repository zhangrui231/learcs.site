The problem to be solved is to decide which coins and how many of each to hand to the customer. Think of a \u201cgreedy\u201d cashier as one who wants to take the biggest bite out of this problem as possible with each coin they take out of the drawer.

Note that a bite of this size would whittle what was a 41\xa2 problem down to a 16\xa2 problem, since 41 - 25 = 16. That is, the remainder is a similar but smaller problem. Needless to say, another 25\xa2 bite would be too big (assuming the cashier prefers not to lose money), and so our greedy cashier would move on to a bite of size 10\xa2, leaving him or her with a 6\xa2 problem.
