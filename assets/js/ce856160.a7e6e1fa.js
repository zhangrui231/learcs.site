It\'s okay to skip directly to the questions and refer back here should you get stuck.\n\nA linked list is a data structure for storing a sequence of values. It is more efficient than a regular built-in list for certain operations, such as inserting a value in the middle of a long list. Linked lists are not built in, and so we define a class called `Link` to represent them.
