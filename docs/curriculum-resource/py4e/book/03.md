# Conditional execution

## Boolean expressions

A _boolean expression_ is an expression that is either true or
false. The following examples use the operator `==`, which
compares two operands and produces `True` if they are equal
and `False` otherwise:

```
>>> 5 == 5
True
>>> 5 == 6
False
```

`True` and `False` are special values that
belong to the class `bool`; they are not strings:

```
>>> type(True)
<class 'bool'>
>>> type(False)
<class 'bool'>
```

The `==` operator is one of the _comparison_
_operators_; the others are:

```
x != y               # x is not equal to y
x > y                # x is greater than y
x < y                # x is less than y
x >= y               # x is greater than or equal to y
x <= y               # x is less than or equal to y
x is y               # x is the same as y
x is not y           # x is not the same as y
```

Although these operations are probably familiar to you, the Python
symbols are different from the mathematical symbols for the same
operations. A common error is to use a single equal sign
( `=`) instead of a double equal sign ( `==`).
Remember that `=` is an assignment operator and
`==` is a comparison operator. There is no such thing as
`=<` or `=>`.

## Logical operators

There are three _logical operators_: `and`,
`or`, and `not`. The semantics (meaning) of these
operators is similar to their meaning in English. For example,

`x > 0 and x < 10`

is true only if `x` is greater than 0 _and_ less
than 10.

`n%2 == 0 or n%3 == 0` is true if _either_ of the
conditions is true, that is, if the number is divisible by 2 _or_
3.

Finally, the `not` operator negates a boolean expression,
so `not (x > y)` is true if `x > y` is
false.

```
>>> x = 1
>>> y = 2
>>> x > y
False
>>> not (x > y)
True
```

Strictly speaking, the operands of the logical operators should be
boolean expressions, but Python is not very strict. Any nonzero number
is interpreted as “true.”

```
>>> 17 and True
True
```

This flexibility can be useful in some situations, but there are some
subtleties to it that might be confusing. You might want to avoid it
until you are sure you know what you are doing.

## Conditional execution

In order to write useful programs, we almost always need the ability
to check conditions and change the behavior of the program accordingly.
_Conditional statements_ give us this ability. The simplest form
is the `if` statement:

```
if x > 0 :
    print('x is positive')
```

The boolean expression after the `if` statement is called
the _condition_. We end the `if` statement with a
colon character (:) and the line(s) after the if statement are
indented.

![If Logic](/img/py4e/if.svg)
If Logic

If the logical condition is true, then the indented statement gets
executed. If the logical condition is false, the indented statement is
skipped.

`if` statements have the same structure as function
definitions or `for` loops [1](https://www.py4e.com/html3/03-conditional#fn1). The statement consists
of a header line that ends with the colon character (:) followed by an
indented block. Statements like this are called _compound_
_statements_ because they stretch across more than one line.

```
if x > y:
    print(x)
    print(y)
```

There is no limit on the number of statements that can appear in the
body, but there must be at least one. Occasionally, it is useful to have
a body with no statements (usually as a place holder for code you
haven’t written yet). In that case, you can use the `pass`
statement to pass the Python interpreter check, which does nothing.

```
if x < 0 :
    pass   # need to handle negative values, do nothing for now.
```

If you enter an `if` statement in the Python interpreter,
the prompt will change from three chevrons (>>>) to three dots
(…) to indicate you are in the middle of a block of statements, as shown
below:

```
>>> x = 3
>>> if x < 10:
...    print('Small')
...
Small
>>>
```

When using the Python interpreter, you must leave a blank line at the
end of a block, otherwise Python will return an error:

```
>>> x = 3
>>> if x < 10:
...    print('Small')
... print('Done')
  File "<stdin>", line 3
    print('Done')
        ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

A blank line at the end of a block of statements is not necessary
when writing and executing a script, but it may improve readability of
your code.

## Alternative execution

A second form of the `if` statement is _alternative_
_execution_, in which there are two possibilities and the condition
determines which one gets executed. The syntax looks like this:

```
if x % 2 == 0:
    print('x is even')
else:
    print('x is odd')
```

If the remainder when `x` is divided by 2 is 0, then we
know that `x` is even, and the program displays a message to
that effect. If the condition is false, the second set of statements is
executed.

![If-Then-Else Logic](/img/py4e/if-else.svg)
If-Then-Else Logic

Since the condition must either be true or false, exactly one of the
alternatives will be executed. The alternatives are called
_branches_, because they are branches in the flow of
execution.

## Chained conditionals

Sometimes there are more than two possibilities and we need more than
two branches. One way to express a computation like that is a
_chained conditional_:

```
if x < y:
    print('x is less than y')
elif x > y:
    print('x is greater than y')
else:
    print('x and y are equal')
```

`elif` is an abbreviation of “else if.” Again, exactly one
branch will be executed.

![If-Then-ElseIf Logic](/img/py4e/elif.svg)
If-Then-ElseIf Logic

There is no limit on the number of `elif` statements. If
there is an `else` clause, it has to be at the end, but there
doesn’t have to be one.

```
if choice == 'a':
    print('Bad guess')
elif choice == 'b':
    print('Good guess')
elif choice == 'c':
    print('Close, but not correct')
```

Each condition is checked in order. If the first is false, the next
is checked, and so on. If one of them is true, the corresponding branch
executes, and the statement ends. Even if more than one condition is
true, only the first true branch executes.

## Nested conditionals

One conditional can also be nested within another. We could have
written the three-branch example like this:

```
if x == y:
    print('x and y are equal')
else:
    if x < y:
        print('x is less than y')
    else:
        print('x is greater than y')
```

The outer conditional contains two branches. The first branch
contains a simple statement. The second branch contains another
`if` statement, which has two branches of its own. Those two
branches are both simple statements, although they could have been
conditional statements as well.

![Nested If Statements](/img/py4e/nested.svg)
Nested If Statements

Although the indentation of the statements makes the structure
apparent, _nested conditionals_ become difficult to read very
quickly. In general, it is a good idea to avoid them when you can.

Logical operators often provide a way to simplify nested conditional
statements. For example, we can rewrite the following code using a
single conditional:

```
if 0 < x:
    if x < 10:
        print('x is a positive single-digit number.')
```

The `print` statement is executed only when we pass both
conditionals. We can get the same effect with the `and`
operator:

```
if 0 < x and x < 10:
    print('x is a positive single-digit number.')
```

## Catching exceptions using try and except

Earlier we saw a code segment where we used the `input`
and `int` functions to read and parse an integer number
entered by the user. We also saw how treacherous doing this could
be:

```
>>> prompt = "What is the air velocity of an unladen swallow?\n"
>>> speed = input(prompt)
What is the air velocity of an unladen swallow?
What do you mean, an African or a European swallow?
>>> int(speed)
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with
base 10: 'What do you mean, an African or a European swallow?'
>>>
```

When we are executing these statements in the Python interpreter, we
get a new prompt from the interpreter, think “oops”, and move on to our
next statement.

However if you place this code in a Python script and this error
occurs, your script immediately stops in its tracks with a traceback. It
does not execute the following statement.

Here is a sample program to convert a Fahrenheit temperature to a
Celsius temperature:

```
inp = input('Enter Fahrenheit Temperature: ')
fahr = float(inp)
cel = (fahr - 32.0) * 5.0 / 9.0
print(cel)

# Code: https://www.py4e.com/code3/fahren.py
```

If we execute this code and give it invalid input, it simply fails
with an unfriendly error message:

```
python fahren.py
Enter Fahrenheit Temperature:72
22.22222222222222
```

```
python fahren.py
Enter Fahrenheit Temperature:fred
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "fahren.py", line 2, in <module>
    fahr = float(inp)
ValueError: could not convert string to float: 'fred'
```

There is a conditional execution structure built into Python to
handle these types of expected and unexpected errors called “try /
except”. The purpose of `try` and `except` is that
you know that some sequence of instruction(s) may have a problem and you
want to add some statements to be executed if an error occurs. These
extra statements (the except block) are ignored if there is no
error.

You can think of the `try` and `except` feature
in Python as an “insurance policy” on a sequence of statements.

We can rewrite our temperature converter as follows:

```
inp = input('Enter Fahrenheit Temperature:')
try:
    fahr = float(inp)
    cel = (fahr - 32.0) * 5.0 / 9.0
    print(cel)
except:
    print('Please enter a number')

# Code: https://www.py4e.com/code3/fahren2.py
```

Python starts by executing the sequence of statements in the
`try` block. If all goes well, it skips the
`except` block and proceeds. If an exception occurs in the
`try` block, Python jumps out of the `try` block
and executes the sequence of statements in the `except`
block.

```
python fahren2.py
Enter Fahrenheit Temperature:72
22.22222222222222
```

```
python fahren2.py
Enter Fahrenheit Temperature:fred
Please enter a number
```

Handling an exception with a `try` statement is called
_catching_ an exception. In this example, the `except`
clause prints an error message. In general, catching an exception gives
you a chance to fix the problem, or try again, or at least end the
program gracefully.

## Short-circuit evaluation of logical expressions

When Python is processing a logical expression such as
`x >= 2 and (x/y) > 2`, it evaluates the expression
from left to right. Because of the definition of `and`, if
`x` is less than 2, the expression `x >= 2` is
`False` and so the whole expression is `False`
regardless of whether `(x/y) > 2` evaluates to
`True` or `False`.

When Python detects that there is nothing to be gained by evaluating
the rest of a logical expression, it stops its evaluation and does not
do the computations in the rest of the logical expression. When the
evaluation of a logical expression stops because the overall value is
already known, it is called _short-circuiting_ the
evaluation.

While this may seem like a fine point, the short-circuit behavior
leads to a clever technique called the _guardian pattern_.
Consider the following code sequence in the Python interpreter:

```
>>> x = 6
>>> y = 2
>>> x >= 2 and (x/y) > 2
True
>>> x = 1
>>> y = 0
>>> x >= 2 and (x/y) > 2
False
>>> x = 6
>>> y = 0
>>> x >= 2 and (x/y) > 2
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
>>>
```

The third calculation failed because Python was evaluating
`(x/y)` and `y` was zero, which causes a runtime
error. But the first and the second examples did _not_ fail
because in the first calculation `y` was non zero and in the
second one the first part of these expressions `x >= 2`
evaluated to `False` so the `(x/y)` was not ever
executed due to the _short-circuit_ rule and there was no
error.

We can construct the logical expression to strategically place a
_guard_ evaluation just before the evaluation that might cause an
error as follows:

```
>>> x = 1
>>> y = 0
>>> x >= 2 and y != 0 and (x/y) > 2
False
>>> x = 6
>>> y = 0
>>> x >= 2 and y != 0 and (x/y) > 2
False
>>> x >= 2 and (x/y) > 2 and y != 0
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
>>>
```

In the first logical expression, `x >= 2` is
`False` so the evaluation stops at the `and`. In
the second logical expression, `x >= 2` is
`True` but `y != 0` is `False` so we
never reach `(x/y)`.

In the third logical expression, the `y != 0` is
_after_ the `(x/y)` calculation so the expression
fails with an error.

In the second expression, we say that `y != 0` acts as a
_guard_ to insure that we only execute `(x/y)` if
`y` is non-zero.

## Debugging

The traceback Python displays when an error occurs contains a lot of
information, but it can be overwhelming. The most useful parts are
usually:

- What kind of error it was, and

- Where it occurred.


Syntax errors are usually easy to find, but there are a few gotchas.
Whitespace errors can be tricky because spaces and tabs are invisible
and we are used to ignoring them.

```
>>> x = 5
>>>  y = 6
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    y = 6
    ^
IndentationError: unexpected indent
```

In this example, the problem is that the second line is indented by
one space. But the error message points to `y`, which is
misleading. In general, error messages indicate where the problem was
discovered, but the actual error might be earlier in the code, sometimes
on a previous line.

In general, error messages tell you where the problem was discovered,
but that is often not where it was caused.

## Exercises

**Exercise 1:** Rewrite your pay computation to give the
employee 1.5 times the hourly rate for hours worked above 40 hours.

```
Enter Hours: 45
Enter Rate: 10
Pay: 475.0
```

**Exercise 2:** Rewrite your pay program using
`try` and `except` so that your program handles
non-numeric input gracefully by printing a message and exiting the
program. The following shows two executions of the program:

```
Enter Hours: 20
Enter Rate: nine
Error, please enter numeric input
```

```
Enter Hours: forty
Error, please enter numeric input
```

**Exercise 3:** Write a program to prompt for a score
between 0.0 and 1.0. If the score is out of range, print an error
message. If the score is between 0.0 and 1.0, print a grade using the
following table:

```
 Score   Grade
>= 0.9     A
>= 0.8     B
>= 0.7     C
>= 0.6     D
 < 0.6     F
```

```
Enter score: 0.95
A
```

```
Enter score: perfect
Bad score
```

```
Enter score: 10.0
Bad score
```

```
Enter score: 0.75
C
```

```
Enter score: 0.5
F
```

Run the program repeatedly as shown above to test the various
different values for input.
