title: Homework 0B Data Structures
---

## Assignment Setup

Please follow the [Assignment Workflow Guide](../../../guides/assignment-workflow/index.md) to get started with this assignment. This assignment is `hw0b`.

## Language Constructs

### Types

Java is a _statically typed_ language, which means that every variable has a type that is known at compile time, meaning you must specify it in your code. In contrast, Python is a _dynamically typed_ language, which means that the type of variables are generally only known at runtime, meaning you do not need to specify them in your code.

In Java, there are two kinds of types: primitive types and reference types.
Primitive types are lowercase, and we named the ones that we care about in
[Part A](../hw0a/index.md#types): `boolean`, `int`, `char`, `double`.
Pretty much every other type is a reference type, such as `String`. If a type
starts with a capital letter, it is likely a reference type.

You will learn more about the distinction between primitive and reference types
in Lecture 4, but for this homework, you will need to know that each primitive
has a corresponding reference type (`Boolean`, `Integer`, `Character`,
`Double`). If you are using "generics" to declare a data structure, you _must_
use the reference type. You can (usually) seamlessly convert between a primitive type
and its reference type.

### null

Java also has `null`, which is the approximate equivalent of `None` in Python.
Any reference type can be assigned a value of `null`. If we try to access an
instance member or call an instance method from a value of `null`, we will see
an error called a `NullPointerException`.

### Arrays (fixed-size)

Java arrays are a lot like Python lists. However, Java arrays are _fixed-size_,
so we can't add or remove elements (that is, no `append`, `remove`, etc.).

<table>
    <thead>
        <th>Python</th>
        <th>Java</th>
    </thead>
<tr>
<td markdown="block">

```python
zeroedLst = [0, 0, 0]
lst = [4, 7, 10]
lst[0] = 5
print(lst[0])
print(lst)
print(len(lst))
```

</td>
<td markdown="block">

```java
int[] zeroedArray = new int[3];
int[] array = {4, 7, 10};
array[0] = 5;
System.out.println(array[0]);
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(array));
System.out.println(array.length);
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

- In `new int[3]`, the `int` is the type in the array; and `3` is the length.
  With this syntax, all elements take on their "default value". For `int`,
  this is 0.
- Arrays do not print nicely, for reasons beyond the scope of HW 0. To print
  an array, you can call `Arrays.toString(array)`.
- Arrays do not have a length _method_. It is an _instance variable_, so
  it does not have parentheses.
- Java does **not** support _negative indexing_ or _slicing_.

### Foreach Loop / Enhanced For Loop

<table>
    <thead>
        <th>Python</th>
        <th>Java</th>
    </thead>
<tr>
<td markdown="block">

```python
lst = [1, 2, 3]
for i in lst:
    print(i)

```

</td>
<td markdown="block">

```java
int[] array = {1, 2, 3};
for (int i : array) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

- Notice the type declaration of the iterating variable, as well as the usage
  of `:` instead of `in`.
- We can also use this syntax on certain other types, such as `List`s and
  `Set`s.

### Lists (resizable)

<table>
    <thead>
        <th>Python</th>
        <th>Java</th>
    </thead>
<tr>
<td markdown="block">

```python
lst = []
lst.append("zero")
lst.append("one")
lst[0] = "zed"
print(l[0])
print(len(l))
if "one" in lst:
    print("one in lst")

for elem in lst:
    print(elem)

```

</td>
<td markdown="block">

```java
List<String> lst = new ArrayList<>();
lst.add("zero");
lst.add("one");
lst.set(0, "zed");
System.out.println(lst.get(0));
System.out.println(lst.size());
if (lst.contains("one")) {
    System.out.println("one in lst");
}
for (String elem : lst) {
    System.out.println(elem);
}
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

- Java has the `List` interface. We largely use the
  [`ArrayList`][`ArrayList`] implementation.
- The `List` interface is _parameterized_ by the type it holds, using the
  angle brackets `<` and `>`.
- `List`s, again, do not support slicing or negative indexing.

[`ArrayList`]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/ArrayList.html

### Sets

<table>
    <thead>
        <th>Python</th>
        <th>Java</th>
    </thead>
<tr>
<td markdown="block">

```python
s = set()
s.add(1)
s.add(1)
s.add(2)
s.remove(2)
print(len(s))
if 1 in s:
    print("1 in s")

for elem in s:
    print(elem)

```

</td>
<td markdown="block">

```java
Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
set.add(1);
set.add(1);
set.add(2);
set.remove(2);
System.out.println(set.size());
if (set.contains(1)) {
    System.out.println("1 in set");
}
for (int elem : set) {
    System.out.println(elem);
}
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

- Java has the `Set` interface. There are two main implementations:
  [`TreeSet`][], and [`HashSet`][]. `TreeSet` keeps its elements in "sorted"
  order, and is fast. In contrast, `HashSet` does not have a defined
  "order", but is (usually) really fast.
  - We will formalize these notions of "fast" later on in the course when we learn about asymptotic analysis.
- A `Set` cannot contain duplicate items. If we try to add an item already in the set, nothing happens.

[`TreeSet`]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/TreeSet.html
[`HashSet`]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/HashSet.html

### Dictionaries / Maps

<table>
    <thead>
        <th>Python</th>
        <th>Java</th>
    </thead>
<tr>
<td markdown="block">

```python
d = {}
d["hello"] = "hi"
d["hello"] = "goodbye"
print(d["hello"])
print(len(d))
if "hello" in d:
    print("\"hello\" in d")

for key in d.keys():
    print(key)

```

</td>
<td markdown="block">

```java
Map<String, String> map = new HashMap<>();
map.put("hello", "hi");
map.put("hello", "goodbye");
System.out.println(map.get("hello"));
System.out.println(map.size());
if (map.containsKey("hello")) {
    System.out.println("\"hello\" in map");
}
for (String key : map.keySet()) {
    System.out.println(key);
}
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

- Java has the `Map` interface. There are two main implementations:
  [`TreeMap`][], and [`HashMap`][]. Similarly to sets, `TreeMap` keeps its
  keys sorted and is fast; `HashMap` has no defined order and is (usually)
  really fast.
- A `Map` cannot contain duplicate keys. If we try to add a key already in the map, the value is overwritten.
- In the angle brackets, we have the "key type" first, followed by the
  "value type".
- `Map`s cannot directly be used with the `:` for loop. Typically, we call
  `keySet` to iterate over a set of the keys, and use those to retrieve the values. One may also iterate over the `entrySet` to get both the keys and values.

[`TreeMap`]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/TreeMap.html
[`HashMap`]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/HashMap.html

### Classes

<table>
    <thead>
        <th>Python</th>
        <th>Java</th>
    </thead>
<tr>
<td markdown="block">

```python
class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def distanceTo(self, other):
        return math.sqrt(
            (self.x - other.x) ** 2 +
            (self.y - other.y) ** 2
        )

    def translate(self, dx, dy):
        self.x += dx
        self.y += dy
```

</td>
<td markdown="block">

```java
public class Point {
    public int x;
    public int y;
    public Point(int x, int y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }
    public Point() {
        this(0, 0);
    }
    public double distanceTo(Point other) {
        return Math.sqrt(
            Math.pow(this.x - other.x, 2) +
            Math.pow(this.y - other.y, 2)
        )
    }
    public void translate(int dx, int dy) {
        this.x += dx;
        this.y += dy;
    }
}
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

We can use these classes as follows:

<table>
    <thead>
        <th>Python</th>
        <th>Java</th>
    </thead>
<tr>
<td markdown="block">

```python
p1 = Point(5, 9)
p2 = Point(-3, 3)
print(f"Point 1: ({p1.x}, {p1.y})")
print("Distance:", p1.distanceTo(p2))
p1.translate(2, 2)
print(f"Point 1: ({p1.x}, {p1.y})")
```

</td>
<td markdown="block">

```java
Point p1 = new Point(5, 9);
Point p2 = new Point(-3, 3);
System.out.println("Point 1: ( " + p1.x
    + ", " + p1.y + ")");
System.out.println("Distance: "
    + p1.distanceTo(p2));
p1.translate(2, 2);
System.out.println("Point 1: ( " + p1.x
    + ", " + p1.y + ")");
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Main

Java programs may also have a special method called `main`. When you execute a program, the `main` method is called. The `main` method runs whatever code is inside, which may call other methods defined within the program.

We define the `main` method with the signature `public static void main(String[] args)`. You will learn the meaning of each part of this signature later in the class. For now, you can treat `main` as a "play button" for the code you have written.

To run the code in the previous example, we may create a `main` method in the `Point` class like this:

<table>
    <thead>
        <th>Python</th>
        <th>Java</th>
    </thead>
<tr>
<td markdown="block">

```python
class Point:

    # other methods...
    # end of Point class

if __name__ == '__main__':
    p1 = Point(5, 9)
    p2 = Point(-3, 3)
    print(f"Point 1: ({p1.x}, {p1.y})")
    print("Distance:", p1.distanceTo(p2))
    p1.translate(2, 2)
    print(f"Point 1: ({p1.x}, {p1.y})")

```

</td>
<td markdown="block">

```java
public class Point {

    // other methods...

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Point p1 = new Point(5, 9);
        Point p2 = new Point(-3, 3);
        System.out.println("Point 1: ( " + p1.x
            + ", " + p1.y + ")");
        System.out.println("Distance: "
            + p1.distanceTo(p2));
        p1.translate(2, 2);
        System.out.println("Point 1: ( " + p1.x
            + ", " + p1.y + ")");
    }

    // end of Point class
}
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

Notice that in Java, the `main` method is defined _within_ a class.

If you are coding in IntelliJ, you can actually "play" the `main` method! IntelliJ will display a green play button to the left of the `main` method's signature. Click it to run the code inside.

## Programs

Let's look at some Java programs that use data structures and classes. Here
are some simple ones that you might find yourself referring to if you forget
how to do something.

### Index of Minimum of a List of Numbers

<table>
    <thead>
        <th>Python</th>
        <th>Java</th>
    </thead>
<tr>
<td markdown="block">

```python
def min_index(numbers):
    # Assume len(numbers) >= 1
    m = numbers[0]
    idx = 0
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        if numbers[i] < m:
            m = numbers[i]
            idx = i
    return idx
```

</td>
<td markdown="block">

```java
public static int minIndex(int[] numbers) {
    // Assume numbers.length >= 1
    int m = numbers[0];
    int idx = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
        if (numbers[i] < m) {
            m = numbers[i];
            idx = i;
        }
    }
    return idx;
}
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

- Programming exercise spec
-->

## Exceptions

Lastly, let's look at how we can throw exceptions in Java compared to Python with previous example.

<table>
    <thead>
        <th>Python</th>
    </thead>
<tr>
<td markdown="block">

```python
def minIndex(numbers):
    if len(numbers) == 0:
        raise Exception("There are no elements in the list!")
    m = numbers[0]
    idx = 0

    ...

    return m
```

</td>
</tr>

<thead>
<th>Java</th>
</thead>
<tr>

<td markdown="block">

```java
public static int minIndex(int[] numbers) {
    if (numbers.length == 0) {
        throw new Exception("There are no elements in the array!");
    }
    int m = numbers[0];
    int idx = 0;

    ...

    return m;
}
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Programming Exercises

In order to get you more familiar with Java syntax and testing, there are a few exercises for you to solve! After you complete the functions, we have provided a handful of tests for you. Although we have provided tests, you are welcome to write your own too! Writing tests is not only crucial for this class but it is one of the most important skills to have in general. It reinforces our understanding of what specific methods are supposed to do and allows us to catch edge cases! You will have more exercises for testing later on in the course but we want you to be exposed early on.

Please complete **Lab 01** prior and refer [here](../../guides/assignment-workflow/) how to start with the assignment.

While completing the assignment, you may need to use different data structures like `ArrayList` and `TreeMap`. In order to import these classes, if you hover over wherever you are using the data structures, IntelliJ will give you option to import it or you can do it manually by adding:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.TreeMap;
```

### Task 1: JavaExercises

`JavaExercises.java` has 4 different methods for you to complete:

- `makeDice`: This method takes returns a _new_ `array` of integers `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
- `takeOrder`: This method takes in a `String` and returns a _new_ array containing the orders of the customer. If the customer is `Ergun`, you should return an array of Strings `["beyti", "pizza", "hamburger", "tea"]` in that order. If the customer is `Erik`, you should return an array of Strings `["sushi", "pasta", "avocado", "coffee"]`. In any other case, return an empty String array of size 3.
  :::info
  > **NOTE:** `==` behaves strangely with `String`s for reasons we'll see later in the course. You should check strings `s1` and `s2` for equality using `s1.equals(s2)` in Java.
- `findMinMax`: This method takes an `int[] array` and returns the the positive difference between the maximum element and minimum element of the given array. You may assume the input array is nonempty.
- `hailstone`: This method takes an `int n` as input and returns its hailstone sequence as a list of integers. The hailstone sequence is defined by the following procedure: pick a positive integer n as the start. If n is even, divide n by 2. If n is odd, multiply n by 3 and add 1. Continue this process until n is 1.
  - You should compute this using recursion with the provided helper method `hailstoneHelper`.

For this part, you can import `List` and `ArrayList`.

### Task 2: ListExercises

`ListExercises.java` has 4 different methods for you to complete:

- `sum`: This method takes a list `List<Integer> L` and returns the total sum of the elements in that list. If the list is empty, the method should return 0.
- `evens`: This method takes a list `List<Integer> L` and returns a _new_ list containing the even numbers of the given list. If there are no even elements, it should return an empty list.
- `common`: This method takes two lists `List<Integer> L1`, `List<Integer> L2` and returns a _new_ list containing the items present in both of the two given lists. If there are no common items, it should return an empty list.
- `countOccurrencesOfC`: This method takes a list and a character `List<String> words`, `char c` and returns the number of occurrences of the given character in a list of strings. If the character does not occur in any of the words, it should return 0.

For this part, you can import `ArrayList`.

### Task 3: MapExercises

`MapExercises.java` has 3 different methods for you to complete:

- `letterToNum`: This method returns a map from every lower case letter to the number corresponding to its ordering in the alphabet, where 'a' corresponds to 1 and 'z' corresponds to 26.
- `squares`: This method takes a list `List<Integer> nums` and returns a map from the integers in the list to their squares. If the given list is empty, it should return an empty map.
- `countWords`: This method takes a list `List<String> words` and returns a map from words in the list to the number of times they appear. If the given list is empty, it should return an empty map.

For this part, you can import `TreeMap`.

### Task 4: Dessert.java

:::info
Compared to your previous classes, 61B may leave a lot of wiggle room for you on assignments. For example, there's no skeleton code for this exercise - don't be alarmed!

Create a class called `Dessert` (you'll need to create a new file and **add it to Git**) inside of the `src/` folder. This class should have the following characteristics:

- Two instance variables: `int flavor` and `int price`.
- A constructor that takes two parameters `int flavor` and `int price` and sets the instance variables accordingly.
- One static variable `int numDesserts` that keeps track of the number of desserts created so far.
- A method `public void printDessert()` that prints the flavor and price of the dessert, along with the total number of desserts created so far, separated by a space.
  - For example, if we create a dessert with flavor 1 and price 2, and then call its `printDessert()` method, it should print `1 2 1`.
  - If we then create a dessert with flavor 3 and price 4, and then call its `printDessert()` method, it should print `3 4 2`.
- Lastly, a method `public static void main(String[] args)` that only prints the line `I love dessert!` when executed.

Be sure to implement the above behavior exactly, otherwise you may not pass the tests!

When you have completed `Dessert.java`, uncomment the appropriate lines in `tests/DessertTest` and run the test.

```

</details>

## Testing and Debugging

If you're having trouble running your code, please read through the common errors in this section before asking course staff!

### Syntax Errors

IntelliJ will not run your code (the green play button will not appear) if your code contains syntax errors.

If your code has syntax errors, you will see a red exclamation point in the top-right corner, and there will be red squiggles in your code. To see where the syntax errors are, you can click on the red exclamation point.

![Syntax Errors](/img/cs61b/syntax-errors.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}

If you are seeing syntax errors in parts of the code that you haven't modified yet, you may have a syntax error earlier in the code (e.g. mismatched brackets), which is causing later parts of the code to not compile.

For example, in the image above, the `takeOrder` method is missing its closing bracket on Line 19. This causes a syntax error on Line 23.

## Deliverables

- `JavaExercises.java`
- `ListExercises.java`
- `MapExercises.java`
- `Dessert.java`

For this assignment, you need to complete the methods in `JavaExercises`, `ListExercises`, and `MapExercises`. You also need to create a new file `Dessert.java` and implement it according to the desired specifications. Make sure you test your code before submitting to Gradescope. Although we do not have a submission limit for this specific assignment, in the future it is encouraged to use existing tests and write your own tests to see if your methods work before submitting your code to the autograder, as there may be limited submissions.

This assignment is **10 points** and due **1/22, 11:59 PM**.
