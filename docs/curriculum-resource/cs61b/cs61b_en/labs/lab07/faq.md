### Why does the root of an LLRB tree always need to be black (note: this only applies if we use colored nodes as our representation instead of links)?

Check out the [LLRB Properties](index.md#llrb-tree-properties) section in the
spec. The root node could technically be colored red and considered to be a
special case, but for consistency with the other nodes and LLRB tree
properties, we choose to require that it is colored black.
