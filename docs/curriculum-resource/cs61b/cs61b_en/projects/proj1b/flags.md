### Flags for add tests

- `add_first_from_empty`: Check that `addFirst` works on an empty deque.
- `add_last_from_empty`: Check that `addLast` works on an empty deque.
- `add_first_nonempty`: Check that `addFirst` works on a non-empty deque.
- `add_last_nonempty`: Check that `addLast` works on a non-empty deque.
- `add_first_trigger_resize`: Check that `addFirst` works when called on a full underlying array
- `add_last_trigger_resize`: Check that `addLast` works when called on a full underlying array

### Flags for add after remove tests

- `add_first_after_remove_to_empty`: Add some elements to a deque and remove them all, then check that `addFirst` still works.
- `add_last_after_remove_to_empty`: Add some elements to a deque and remove them all, then check that `addLast` still works.

### Flags for remove Tests

- `remove_first`: Check that `removeFirst` works.
- `remove_last`: Check that `removeLast` works.
- `remove_first_to_empty`: Add some elements to a deque and remove almost all of them. Check that removing the last element with `removeFirst` works.
- `remove_last_to_empty`: Add some elements to a deque and remove almost all of them. Check that removing the last element with `removeLast` works.
- `remove_first_to_one`: Add some elements to a deque and remove almost all of them. Check that removing the second to last element with `removeFirst` works.
- `remove_last_to_one`: Add some elements to a deque and remove almost all of them. Check that removing the second to last element with `removeLast` works.
- `remove_first_trigger_resize`: Called when usage factor is <= 25% and array size > 8. Checks that the array resizes appropriately.
- `remove_last_trigger_resize`: Called when usage factor is <= 25% and array size > 8. Checks that the array resizes appropriately.

### Flags for get Tests

- `get_valid`: Check that get works on a valid index.
- `get_oob_large`: Check that get works on a large, out of bounds index.
- `get_oob_neg`: Check that get works on a negative index.

### Flags for size tests

- `size`: Check that size works.
- `size_after_remove_to_empty`: Add some elements to a deque and remove them all, then check that size still works.
- `size_after_remove_from_empty`: Remove from an empty deque, then check that size still works.

### Flags for isEmpty Tests

- `is_empty_true`: Check that size works on an empty deque.
- `is_empty_false`: Check that size works on a non- empty deque.

### Flags for toList tests

- `to_list_empty`: Check that `toList` works with empty `ArrayDeque`.
- `to_list_nonempty`: Check that `toList` works with non-empty `ArrayDeque`.

### Flags for advanced resize tests

- `resize_up_and_resize_down`: Trigger a resize up and then a resize down in the same test.
