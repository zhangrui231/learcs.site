## FAQ

The FAQ for this lab can be found [here](faq.md).

## Introduction

In this lab, you'll work on `MyHashMap`, a hashtable-based implementation of
the `Map61B` interface. This will be very similar to Lab 06, except this time
we're building a `HashMap` rather than a `TreeMap`.

After you've completed your implementation, you'll compare the performance of
your implementation to a list-based Map implementation `ULLMap` as well as the
built-in Java `HashMap` class (which also uses a hash table). We'll also compare
the performance of `MyHashMap` when it uses different data structures to be the
buckets.

## MyHashMap

### Overview

We've created a class `MyHashMap` in `MyHashMap.java`, with very minimal starter
code. Your goal is to implement all of the methods in the `Map61B` interface
from which `MyHashMap` inherits, _except_ `remove`, `keySet` and `iterator`
(optional for Lab 08). For these, feel free to throw an
`UnsupportedOperationException`.

Note that your code will not compile until you implement all the methods of
`Map61B`. You can implement methods one at a time by writing the method
signatures of all the required methods, but throwing
`UnsupportedOperationException`s for the implementations until you get around to
actually writing them.

### Refresher Animation

The following is a quick animation of how a hash table works. `N` refers to the
number of items in the hash table, and `M` refers to the number of buckets.

We use an object's `hashCode` modulo'd (%) by the number of buckets to determine
which bucket the object (represented by a shape) falls into. When the load
factor is reached, we multiply the number of buckets by the resizing factor and
rehash all of the items, modulo-ing them by the new number of buckets.

For the video animation below, the hash function is arbitrary and outputs a random 
integer for each shape (the object) that is inputted.

### Skeleton Code

You might recall from lecture that when we build a hash table, we can choose a
number of different data structures to be the buckets. The classic approach is
to choose a `LinkedList`. But we can also choose `ArrayList`s, `TreeSet`s, or
even other crazier data structures like `PriorityQueue`s or even other
`HashSet`s!

![ht-buckets](/img/cs61b/ht-buckets.png)

During this lab, we will try out hash tables with different data structures for
each of the buckets, and see empirically if there is an asymptotic difference
between using different data structures as hash table buckets.

For this lab, we will be trying out `LinkedList`, `ArrayList`, `HashSet`,
`Stack`, and `ArrayDeque` (unfortunately, no `TreeSet` or `PriorityQueue` like
the diagram above shows due to excessive boilerplate, though you're welcome to
try it if you'd like). That's a lot of classes!

You can imagine that if we implemented `MyHashMap` without much care, it would
take a lot of effort with Find + Replace to be able to change out the bucket
type with a different bucket type. For example, if we wanted to change all our
`ArrayList` buckets to `LinkedList` buckets, we would have to Find + Replace for
all occurrences of `ArrayList` and replace that with `LinkedList`. This is not
ideal - for example, we may have a non-bucket component that relies on some
`ArrayList` methods. We wouldn't want to ruin our code by changing that to a
`LinkedList`!

The purpose of the starter code is to have an easier way to try out different
bucket types with `MyHashMap`. It accomplishes this through polymorphism and
inheritance, which we learned about earlier this semester. It also makes use of
**factory methods and classes**, which are utility code used to create objects.
This is a common pattern when working with more advanced code, though the
details are out-of-scope for 61B.

`MyHashMap` implements the `Map61B` interface through use of a hash table. In
the starter code, we give the instance variable
`private Collection<Node>[] buckets`, which is the underlying data structure of
the hash table. Let's unpack what this code means:

- `buckets` is a `private` variable in the `MyHashMap` class.
```java
private Collection<Node>[] buckets;
```
- It is an array (or table) of `Collection<Node>` objects, where each
  `Collection` of `Node`s represents a single bucket in the hash table
- `Node` is a private (nested) helper class we give that stores a single key-value
  mapping. The starter code for this class should be straightforward to
  understand, and should not require any modification.
```java
protected class Node {
    K key;
    V value;

    Node(K k, V v) {
        key = k;
        value = v;
    }
}
```
- [`java.util.Collection`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Collection.html)
  is an interface which most data structures inherit from, and it represents a
  group of objects. The `Collection` interface supports methods such as `add`,
  `remove`, and `iterator`. Many data structures in `java.util` implement
  `Collection`, including `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, `TreeSet`, `HashSet`,
  `PriorityQueue`, and many others. Note that because these data structures
  implement `Collection`, we can assign them to a variable of static type
  `Collection` with polymorphism.
- Therefore, our array of `Collection<Node>` objects can be instantiated by many
  different types of data structures, e.g. `LinkedList<Node>` or
  `ArrayList<Node>`.
  **Make sure your buckets generalize to any Collection!** See the below warning
  for how to do this.
- When creating a new `Collection<Node>[]` to store in our `buckets` variable,
  be aware that in Java, you
  [cannot create an array of parameterized type](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/restrictions.html#createArrays).
  `Collection<Node>` is a parameterized type, because we parameterize the
  `Collection` class with the `Node` class. Therefore, Java disallows
  `new Collection<Node>[size]`, for any given `size`. If you try to do this, you
  will get a "Generic array creation" error.

:::warning
To get around this, you should instead create a `new Collection[size]`, where `size` is the
desired size.

- The elements of a `Collection[]` can be a collection of any
  type, like a `Collection<Integer>` or a `Collection<Node>`. **For our purposes,
  we will only add elements of type `Collection<Node>` to our `Collection[]`.**

The mechanism by which different implementations of the hash table implement 
different buckets is through a factory method
`protected Collection<Node> createBucket()`, which simply returns a
`Collection`. For `MyHashMap.java`, you can choose any data structure you'd
like. For example, if you choose `LinkedList`, the body of `createBucket` would
simply be:

```java
protected Collection<Node> createBucket() {
	return new LinkedList<>();
}
```

:::warning
**Instead of creating new bucket data structures with the `new` operator, you
must use the `createBucket` method instead**. This might seem useless at first,
but it allows our factory classes to override the `createBucket` method in order
to provide different data structures as each of the buckets. <br/><br/>
In `MyHashMap`, you can just have this method return a new `LinkedList` or
`ArrayList`.

### Implementation Requirements

You should implement the following constructors:

```java
public MyHashMap();
public MyHashMap(int initialCapacity);
public MyHashMap(int initialCapacity, double loadFactor);
```

Some additional requirements for `MyHashMap` are below:

- Your hash map should initially have a number of buckets equal to
  `initialCapacity`. You should increase the size of your `MyHashMap` when the
  load factor exceeds the maximum `loadFactor` threshold. Recall that the
  current **load factor** can be computed as `loadFactor = N/M`, where `N` is
  the number of elements in the map and `M` is the number of buckets. The load
  factor represents the amount of elements per bucket, on average. If
  `initialCapacity` and `loadFactor` aren't given, you should set defaults
  `initialCapacity = 16` and `loadFactor = 0.75` (as Java's [built-in HashMap](<https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/HashMap.html#%3Cinit%3E()>) does).
- You should handle collisions with separate chaining. You should not use any
  libraries other than the bucket classes, `Collection`, `Iterator`, `Set`, and
  `HashSet`. For more detail on how you should implement separate chaining, see
  the **Skeleton Code** section above.
- Because we use a `Collection<Node>[]` for our `buckets`, when implementing
  `MyHashMap`, you are restricted to using methods that are specified by the
  `Collection` interface. **When you are searching for a `Node` in a `Collection`,
   iterate over the `Collection`, and find the `Node` whose `key` is
  `.equals()` to the desired key.**
- If the same key is inserted more than once, the value should be updated each
  time (i.e., no `Node`s should be added). You can assume `null` keys will never
  be inserted.
- When resizing, make sure to multiplicatively (geometrically) resize, not
  additively (arithmetically) resize. You are **not** required to resize down.
- `MyHashMap` operations should all be constant amortized time, assuming that
  the `hashCode` of any objects inserted spread things out nicely (**recall: every
  `Object` in Java has its own `hashCode()` method**).

`hashCode()` can return a _negative value_! Java's modulo operator `%` will
return a negative value for negative inputs, but we need to send items to a
bucket in the range $[0, M)$. There are a myriad of ways to handle this:

1. (Recommended) You can use `Math.floorMod()` in place of `%` for the modulo
   operation. This has a non-negative range of values, similar to Python's modulo.
2. If the resulting value after the `%` operation is negative, you can add
   the size of the array to it.
3. You can use the `Math.abs()` function to convert the negative value to a
   positive value. Note that $|x| \, \mathrm{mod} \, m$,
   $|x \, \mathrm{mod} \, m|$, and $x \, \mathrm{mod} \, m$
   **are not equivalent in general**! We're just using the modulo operation here
   to make sure we have a valid index. We don't necessarily care too much about
   the exact bucket the item goes into, because a good hash function should
   spread things out nicely over positive and negative numbers.
4. Option (3) but with a bitmask (don't worry if you don't know what this
   means). This is out-of-scope for 61B, but some of the resources do this,
   which is why we've put it here.

{: .task}
Complete the `MyHashMap` class according to the specifications in `Map61B` 
and the guidelines above.

### Resources

You may find the following resources useful

- Lecture slides:
  - [Lecture 19](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sVRw4ec0Kq41_OSB-ix94u09WyQnHWf0YsOhlclnM0w)
  - [Lecture 20](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1y0iOW7U3UAiO6lK3ArrVHSwDbX998Q4YDcZ_HeToL2s/)

The following may contain antiquated code or use unfamiliar techniques, but should
still be useful:

- `ULLMap.java` (provided), a working unordered linked list based `Map61B` implementation

### Testing

You can test your implementation using `TestMyHashMap.java`. Some of the tests
are quite tricky and do weird stuff we haven't learned in 61B. The
comments will prove useful to see what the tests are actually doing.

If you've correctly implemented generic `Collection` buckets, you should also be
passing the tests in `TestMyHashMapBuckets.java`. The
`TestMyHashMapBuckets.java` file simply calls methods in `TestMyHashMap.java`
for each of the different map subclasses that implement a different bucket data
structure. Make sure you've correctly implemented `MyHashMap` using the factory
methods provided (i.e., `createBucket`) for `TestHashMapBuckets.java` to pass.

If you choose to implement the additional `remove`, `keySet`, and `iterator`
methods, we provide some tests in `TestHashMapExtra.java`.

## Speed Testing

There are two interactive speed tests provided in `InsertRandomSpeedTest.java`
and `InsertInOrderSpeedTest.java`. Do not attempt to run these tests before
you've completed `MyHashMap`. Once you're ready, you can run the tests in
IntelliJ.

The `InsertRandomSpeedTest` class performs tests on element-insertion speed of
your `MyHashMap`, **ULLMap** (provided), and Java's built-in **HashMap**. It
works by asking the user for an input size `N`, then generates `N` Strings of
length `10` and inserts them into the maps as `<String, Integer>` pairs.

Try it out and see how your data structure scales with `N` compared to the naive
and industrial-strength implementations. Record your results in the provided
file named `src/results.txt`. There is no standard format required for
your results, and there is no required number of data points. We expect you to
write at least a sentence or two with your observations, though.

Now try running `InsertInOrderSpeedTest`, which behaves similarly to
`InsertRandomSpeedTest`, except this time the `String`s in `<String, Integer>`
key-value pairs are inserted in [lexicographically-increasing
order](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographical_order). Your code should be in the rough ballpark of Java's built in solution -- say,
within a factor of 10 or so. What this tells us is that state-of-the-art
`HashMaps` are relatively easy to implement compared to state-of-the-art
`TreeMaps`. Consider this relation with `BSTMap`/`TreeMap` and other data structures - 
are there certain instances where a `Hashmap` might be better? Discuss this with your 
peers, and add your answer to `results.txt`.

## Different Bucket Types

If you've correctly implemented generic `Collection` buckets, most of the work
is done! We can directly compare the different data structures used to implement
buckets. We provide `speed/BucketsSpeedTest.java`, which is an
interactive test that queries the user for an integer `L` for the length of
string to use on subsequent operations. Then, in a loop, it queries the user for
an integer `N`, and runs a speed test on your `MyHashMap` using different types of
buckets.

Try it out and compare how the different implementations scale with `N`. Discuss
your results with your peers, and record your responses in `results.txt`.

You might notice that our implementation using `HashSet`s as buckets searches
for a `Node` by iterating over the entire data structure. But we know hash
tables support more efficient lookups than that. Would our hash table speed up
asymptotically if we were able to use a constant-time search over the `HashSet`?
You do not need to implement anything new here, just discuss with your peers,
and record your ideas in `results.txt`.

{: .task}
Run the above speed tests in the `speed` directory and record your results in `results.txt`.

## Deliverables and Scoring

The lab is out of 5 points. There is one
hidden test on Gradescope (that checks your `results.txt`). The rest of the
tests are local. If you pass all the local tests and fill out the `results.txt`
file sufficiently, you will get full credit on Gradescope.

Each of the following is worth $\frac{5}{11}$ points and corresponds to a unit test:

- Generics
- `clear`
- `containsKey`
- `get`
- `size`
- `put`
- Functionality
- Resizing
- Edge cases
- Buckets (all of `TestMyHashMapBuckets`)
- `results.txt` (not tested locally, but on the Gradescope autograder)

As mentioned, if you are not implementing the [optional exercises](#optional-exercises), 
throw an `UnsupportedOperationException`, like below:

```
throw new UnsupportedOperationException(); 
```

## Submission

Just as you did for the previous assignments, add, commit, then push your Lab 08
code to GitHub. Then, submit to Gradescope to test your code. 

## Optional Exercises

These will not be graded, but you can still receive feedback with the given tests.

Implement the methods `remove(K key)` and `remove(K key, V value)`, in your
`MyHashMap` class. For an extra challenge, implement `keySet()` and `iterator()`
without using a second instance variable to store the set of keys.

For `remove`, you should return `null` if the argument key does not exist in the
`MyHashMap`. Otherwise, delete the key-value pair (key, value) and return the
associated value.
