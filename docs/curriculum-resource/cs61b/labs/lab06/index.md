title: Lab 06 BSTMap
---

## FAQ

The FAQ for this lab can be found [here](faq.md).

## Introduction

In this lab, you'll create `BSTMap`, a BST-based implementation of the `Map61B`
interface, which represents a basic tree-based map. You will be creating this
completely from scratch, using the interface provided as your guide.

After you've completed your implementation, you'll compare the performance of
your implementation to a list-based `Map` implementation `ULLMap` as well as the
built-in Java `TreeMap` class (which uses a BST variant known as a _red-black tree_).

## Pulling from skeleton

To get the assignment, pull from the `skeleton` in your personal repository: 

```shell
git pull skeleton main
```

This assignment is `lab06`.

## `BSTMap`

In this lab (and future labs), we may not provide as much skeleton code as in
the past. If you're having trouble getting started, please come in to lab or check 
out any of the resources provided! 

Create a class `BSTMap` that implements the `Map61B` interface using a BST
(Binary Search Tree) as its core data structure. Your code will not compile until 
you create the `BSTMap` class and implement all the methods in `Map61B`. 
You can implement methods one at a time by writing the method signatures
of all the required methods, but throwing `UnsupportedOperationException`s 
for the other implementations until you get around to actually writing them.
Refer to this [section](#exercise-bstmap) on how to throw the exception.

In your implementation, you should ensure that generic keys `K` in `BSTMap<K,V>`
implement
[Comparable](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Comparable.html).
This is called a [_bounded type parameter_](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/bounded.html).

[The syntax](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/bounded.html)
is a little tricky, but we've given an example below. Here, we are creating
a `BSTSet` for `Comparable` objects. We've included the rather strange
`compareRoots` for pedagogical purposes (for a `compareTo` refresher, see this
[documentation](<https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Comparable.html#compareTo(T)>)):

```java
public class BSTSet<K extends Comparable<K>> implements Set61B<K> {
    private class BSTNode {
        K item;
        // ...
    }

    private BSTNode root;

    /* Returns whether this BSTSet's root is greater than, equal to, or less
     * than the other BSTSet's root, following the usual `compareTo`
     * convention. */
    public int compareRoots(BSTSet other) {
        /* We are able to safely invoke `compareTo` on `n1.item` because we
         * know that `K` extends `Comparable<K>`, so `K` is a `Comparable`, and
         *`Comparable`s must implement `compareTo`. */
        return this.root.item.compareTo(other.root.item);
    }

    // ...
}

```

:::info
You may have noticed that the syntax for a bounded type parameter uses `extends`
even though `Comparable` is an `interface`. In the context of bounded type
parameters, `extends` can mean `extends` or `implements`
([docs](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/bounded.html)). Don't ask us why - we don't know either. <br/><br/>
(The syntax also implies you can "extend" `final` classes such as `Integer`,
which is impossible. Go Java!)

:::warning
Remember, the code snippet above emulates a `Set` - you'll need to implement a
`Map`. We recommend you use similar logic for `BSTMap`, with some nested node
class to help facilitate your implementation. Your `BSTMap` should have two
generic parameters `K` and `V`, representing the generic types of the keys and
values in your `BSTMap`, respectively.

IntelliJ has a nice feature that will generate the method signatures for you. If
you're implementing an interface and haven't implemented all the methods,
IntelliJ will highlight the class signature in red. If you hover over this, you
should be able to select `Implement methods`. On the pop-up window, make sure you've 
selected the option for "Copy JavaDoc" and "Insert @Override". Click "OK" 
and IntelliJ should populate the class with the required method signatures 
(they won't be functional though!) and copy over the comments. 

It should look something like this (**you don't have `Set61B`, this is just an
example!**):

![Implement methods](/img/cs61b/implement-methods.png){: style="max-height: 200;" }

![Select methods to implement](/img/cs61b/select-methods-to-implement.png)

In this example, IntelliJ will generate the `clear`, `size`, and `iterator`
method signatures, because that's all our mythical `Set61B` interface
requires. If you follow this procedure with your code, you should have all the
method signatures required for `Map61B`. (You can also pick and choose 
which signatures to generate, if you'd like.)

### Exercise: `BSTMap`

As mentioned, you'll want to create a class, `BSTMap`, that implements the `Map61B` interface.
Make sure you are writing your implementation in `BSTMap.java`, otherwise your code might not
run on the autograder! The following methods are required:
- `void put(K key, V value)`: Associates the specified `key` with the `value`.
- `V get(K key)`: Returns the value that is associated with `key`.
- `boolean containsKey(K key)`: Returns if this map has a mapping for the given `key`.
- `int size()`: Returns the number of key-value mappings.
- `void clear()`: Removes every mapping from this map.

Make sure to read through the comments for each method in the `Map61B` interface
to fully understand what to implement. The above descriptions are not necessarily
comprehensive.

For debugging purposes, your `BSTMap` should also include an additional method
`printInOrder()` (not given in the `Map61B` interface) that prints out your
`BSTMap` in order of increasing Key. **We will not test the result of this method,
but you may find this helpful for testing your implementation!**

:::task
Implement the `BSTMap` class, which implements the `Map61B` interface
and the associated, non-optional methods. You should ensure that the keys in
your `BSTMap` are `Comparable` by using a bounded type parameter. <br/><br/>
We _strongly recommend_ you create helper methods to facilitate your implementation
(specifically, recursive helper methods are strongly encouraged).

:::info
Unfortunately, most methods you need to implement rely on others for testing 
purposes (`get` requires `put`, etc.). This makes it difficult to test most methods until
you implement `put`. We recommend you implement the methods in the order
specified in `Map61B`. <br/><br/> You can test your implementation
using `TestBSTMap.java`.

**There is an optional part of `BSTMap`. These methods are optional to implement:
`iterator`, `remove`, `keySet`.** They are not required for the timing portion, described in this 
[section](#so-how-fast-is-it).

As mentioned, if you are not implementing the optional part, throw an
`UnsupportedOperationException`, like below:

```
throw new UnsupportedOperationException(); 
```

If you are completing the optional part, refer to this
[section](#more-ungraded-exercises-for-bstmap)
and the comments in `Map61B` for a more detailed description.

### Resources

The following resources might prove useful:

- Lecture 16 [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tAXgjwVKsnH7AR-iCvkDM-rQFwrg4OnKVZzqPixZWI8/edit?usp=sharing).
- `ULLMap.java` (given in `src/`), an unordered, linked-list-based `Map61B`
  implementation.
- To help you also get started, an algorithmic guide to `put` and `get` can be
  found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3_Luw2M8X4)

## So... How Fast Is It?

There is one interactive speed test provided in `InsertRandomSpeedTest.java`. 
Do not attempt to run this test before you've completed `BSTMap`. 
Once you're ready, you can run the tests in IntelliJ.

The `InsertRandomSpeedTest` class performs tests on element-insertion speed of
your `BSTMap`, `ULLMap` (provided), Java's built-in `TreeMap`, and Java's
built-in `HashMap` (which you'll explore more in a later lab). It works by
asking the user for a desired length of each String to insert, and also for an
input size (the number of insertions to perform). It then generates that many
Strings of length as specified and inserts them into the maps as
`<String, Integer>` pairs.

Try it out and see how your data structure scales with the number of insertions
compared to the naive and industrial-strength implementations. Remember that
asymptotics aren't representative on small samples, so make sure your inputs
are sufficiently large if you are getting a confusing trend (keep in mind that there 
is a limit thought - if you enter too large of a value, the program might overflow, 
so play around with sufficiently large values). Record your results
in a file named `speedTestResults.txt`.

:::task
Run the speed tests and record your results in `speedTestResults.txt`.
There is no standard format required for your results, but at a minimum, you
should include what you did and what you observed.

## Scoring

The lab is out of 5 points. There are no hidden tests on Gradescope, in the sense that
the score you get on Gradescope is your final score. However, there is one test not provided
locally, which checks for your `speedTestResults.txt`. Passing the local test `TestBSTMap.java`
means that you will get full credit for `BSTMap.java`, but not necessarily for your `speedTestResults.txt`
on Gradescope. **So, for this lab, as long as you pass the relevant local tests (`TestBSTMap.java`) and 
fill out the `speedTestResults.txt` file sufficiently, you will get full credit on Gradescope.**

## More (Ungraded) Exercises for `BSTMap`

These will not be graded, but you can still receive feedback using the local
tests, specifically `TestBSTMapExtra.java` (and on the autograder).

Implement the methods `iterator()`, `keySet()`, `remove(K key)` in your `BSTMap`
class. When implementing the `iterator` method, you should return an iterator
over the _keys_, in _sorted order_. `remove()` is fairly
challenging - you'll need to implement Hibbard deletion.

For `remove`, you should return `null` if the argument key does not exist in the
`BSTMap`. Otherwise, delete the key-value pair (key, value) and return value.

## Submission

Just as you did for the previous assignments, add, commit, then push your Lab 06
code to GitHub. Then, submit to Gradescope to test your code. 

## Optional: Asymptotics Problems

This part is also optional, and we've included it here for additional practice on asymptotics. 
Check your answers against the [solutions](asymptotics-soln.md)!

Given `B`, a `BSTMap` with `N` key-value pairs, and `(K, V)`, a random key-value pair, answer the following questions.

Unless otherwise stated, "big-Oh" bounds (e.g. $\mathcal{O}(N)$) and "big-Theta" bounds (e.g. $\Theta(N)$) 
refer to the **number of comparisons** in the given method call(s).

For questions 1-7, state whether the statement is true or false. For question 8, give a runtime bound.

1. `B.put(K, V)` $\in \mathcal{O}(\log N)$
2. `B.put(K, V)` $\in \Theta(\log N)$
3. `B.put(K, V)` $\in \Theta(N)$
4. `B.put(K, V)` $\in \mathcal{O}(N)$
5. `B.put(K, V)` $\in \mathcal{O}(N^2)$

{:start="6"} 
1. For a fixed key `C` not equal to `K`, both `B.containsKey(C)` and `B.containsKey(K)` run in $\Omega(\log N).$
2. (This question is quite difficult.) Let `b` be a `Node` of a `BSTMap`, and two subtrees rooted at `root`, called `left` and `right`. Further, assume the method `numberOfNodes(Node p)` returns the number of nodes ($M$) of the subtree rooted at `p` and runs in $\Theta(M)$ time. What is the running time, in both the worst and best case, of `mystery(b.root, z)`, assuming `1 <= z < numberOfNodes(b.root)`?

Hint: See if you can work out what `mystery` does first, then see how it accomplishes it.

```java
public Key mystery(Node b, int z) {
    int numLeft = numberOfNodes(b.left);
    if (numLeft == z - 1) {
        return b.key;
    } else if (numLeft > z) {
        return mystery(b.left, z);
    } else {
        return mystery(b.right, z - numLeft - 1);
    }
}
```
