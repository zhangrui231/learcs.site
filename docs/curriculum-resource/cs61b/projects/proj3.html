You can also access it by adding &quot;/faq&quot; to the end of the URL. The
FAQ for Project 3 is located <a href="/docs/curriculum-resource/cs61b/projects/proj3/faq">here</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="introduction">Introduction<a href="#introduction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Introduction" title="Direct link to Introduction">​</a></h2><p>In Project 3, you will create an engine for generating explorable worlds. This is a large design project that will
require you and one partner to work through every stage of development from ideation to presentation. The goal of this
project is to teach you how to handle a larger piece of code with little starter code in the hopes of emulating
something like a product development cycle. In accordance with this, the grading of this project will be different from
other projects. Since there is no notion of &quot;the correct answer&quot; when it comes to world design and implementation, you
will be assessed much like a performance review you might receive at an internship or job in addition to a very general
autograder. While this means you will be graded slightly subjectively, we promise to be pretty nice bosses and will
respect you as any boss should respect their hardworking employees. Please talk to us if you feel the grading scheme
feels unfair.</p><p>This project will require you a great deal of exploration and experimentation. Searching the web for answers (not
solutions from past semesters) should be a regular activity throughout this process. Please know that there are no right
and wrong answers, as this is a very open-ended project. However, there are some implementations and ideas that are
better than others. It is ok and expected that you will go through several iterations before settling on something that
you deem good. That is, this project is about <strong>software engineering</strong>.</p><p>You&#x27;re not required to use any of the fancy data structures or concepts from class (A<!-- -->*<!-- -->, MSTs, Disjoint Sets, etc.). This
project is about software engineering, not about data structures or algorithms. The data structures and algorithms we&#x27;ve
learned about in class will make your code significantly simpler and more efficient, but please don&#x27;t use things just
because we learned about them in class. Only use these tools if you feel comfortable using them in your implementation.</p><p>A video playlist (from Spring 2018) discussing tips for working on this project can be
found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8FaHk7qbOD6REWjsJd5jz9fpXO5_3ebY&amp;disable_polymer=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">at this link</a>.
A walkthrough of the new skeleton code is also available <a href="https://youtu.be/A8NlkICBWL8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><p>Please also note that since the structure of the project has been changed, Phase 1 will refer to part 3A of the project.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="deliverables">Deliverables<a href="#deliverables" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Deliverables" title="Direct link to Deliverables">​</a></h2><p>Project 3 is worth 125 points.

By &quot;tile-based&quot;,
we mean the worlds you generate will consist of a 2D grid of tiles. By &quot;world exploration engine&quot; we mean that your
software will build a world, which the user will be able to explore by walking around and interacting with objects in
that world. Your world will have an overhead perspective. As an example of a much more sophisticated system than you
will build, the NES game &quot;Zelda II&quot; is (sometimes) a tile based world exploration engine that happens to be a video
game:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/31358-zelda-ii-the-adventure-of-link-nes-screenshot-an-overhead-view.jpg" alt="Zelda2" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The system you build can either use graphical tiles (as shown above), or it can use text based tiles, like
the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/broguegame/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">game shown below</a>:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="brogue" src="/assets/images/brogue_textbased_example-1948358160fbca02fe564f59e1c3c0e7.png" width="1268" height="901" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>We will provide a tile renderer, a small set of starter tiles, and the headers for a few required methods that must be
implemented for your world engine and that will be used by the autograder. The project will have two major deadlines. By
the first deadline, you should be able to generate random worlds that meet the criteria below. By the second deadline, a
user should be able to explore and interact with the world.</p><p>The major goal of this project is to give you a chance to attempt to manage the complexity that comes with building a
large system. Be warned: The system you build probably isn&#x27;t going to be that fun for users! Three weeks is simply not
enough time, particularly for novice programmers. However, we do hope you will find it to be a fulfilling project, and
the worlds you generate might even be beautiful.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="project-setup">Project Setup<a href="#project-setup" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Project Setup" title="Direct link to Project Setup">​</a></h2><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-warning alert alert--danger admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 12 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M5.05.31c.81 2.17.41 3.38-.52 4.31C3.55 5.67 1.98 6.45.9 7.98c-1.45 2.05-1.7 6.53 3.53 7.7-2.2-1.16-2.67-4.52-.3-6.61-.61 2.03.53 3.33 1.94 2.86 1.39-.47 2.3.53 2.27 1.67-.02.78-.31 1.44-1.13 1.81 3.42-.59 4.78-3.42 4.78-5.56 0-2.84-2.53-3.22-1.25-5.61-1.52.13-2.03 1.13-1.89 2.75.09 1.08-1.02 1.8-1.86 1.33-.67-.41-.66-1.19-.06-1.78C8.18 5.31 8.68 2.45 5.05.32L5.03.3l.02.01z"></path></svg></span>danger</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>THE SETUP FOR THIS PROJECT IS DIFFERENT THAN THE OTHER LABS / PROJECTS.

The tile engine is described in <a href="/docs/curriculum-resource/cs61b/labs/lab09">lab 9</a>.</li><li>The generated world must include distinct rooms and hallways, though it may also include outdoor spaces.</li><li>At least some rooms should be rectangular, though you may support other shapes as well.</li><li>Your world generator must be capable of generating hallways that include turns (or equivalently, straight hallways
that intersect). Random worlds should generate a turning hallway with moderate frequency (20% of worlds or more).</li><li>Dead-end hallways are not allowed.</li><li>Rooms and hallways must have walls that are visually distinct from floors. Walls and floors should be visually
distinct from unused spaces. </li><li>Corner walls are optional.</li><li>Rooms and hallways should be connected, i.e. there should not be gaps in the floor between adjacent rooms or hallways.</li><li>All rooms should be reachable, i.e. there should be no rooms with no way to enter.</li><li>Rooms cannot clip off the edge of the world. In other words, there should be no floor tiles on the edge of the world.</li><li>The world must not have excess unused space. While this criterion is inherently subjective, aim to populate above
50% of the world with rooms and hallways.</li></ul><p><strong>Sufficiently Random</strong></p><ul><li>The world must be pseudo-randomly generated. Pseudo-randomness is discussed in lab 9.</li><li>The world should contain a random number of rooms and hallways.</li><li>The locations of the rooms and hallways should be random.</li><li>The width and height of rooms should be random.</li><li>Hallways should have a width of 1 tile and a random length.</li><li>The world should be substantially different each time, i.e. you should <strong>NOT</strong> have the same basic layout with easily
predictable features.</li></ul><p>As an example of a world that meets all of these requirements (click for higher resolution), see the image below. In
this image, # represents a wall tile, a dot represents a floor tile.

games. <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/broguegame/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brogue</a> is an example of a particularly elegant, beautiful
game. <a href="http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dwarf Fortress</a> is an example of an incredibly byzantine, absurdly complex

Let&#x27;s call
this <code>TETile[][] world</code> for now. <strong><code>world[0][0]</code> corresponds to the bottom left tile of the world.</strong> The first coordinate is
the x coordinate, e.g. <code>world[9][0]</code> refers to the tile 9 spaces over to the right from the bottom left tile. The second
coordinate is the y coordinate, and the value increases as we move upwards, e.g. <code>world[0][5]</code> is 5 tiles up from the
bottom left tile. All values should be non-null, i.e. make sure to fill them all in before calling <code>renderFrame</code>. <strong>Make
sure you understand the orientation of the world grid!</strong> If you&#x27;re unsure, write short sample programs that draw to the
grid to deepen your understanding. <strong>If you mix up x vs. y or up vs. down, you&#x27;re going to have an incredibly confusing
time debugging.</strong></p><p>We have provided a small set of default tiles in <code>Tileset.java</code> and these should serve as a good example of how to
create <code>TETile</code> objects. We strongly recommend adding your own tiles as well.</p><p>The tile engine also supports graphical tiles! To use graphical tiles, simply provide the filename of the tile as the
fifth argument to the <code>TETile</code> constructor. Images must be 16 x 16, and should ideally be in PNG format. There is a
large number of open source tile-sets available online for tile based games. Feel free to use these.</p><p>Any <code>TETile</code> object you create should be given a unique character that other tiles do not use. Even if you are using
your own images for rendering the tile, each <code>TETile</code> should still have its own character representation.</p><p>If you do not supply a filename, or the file cannot be opened, then the tile engine will use the unicode character
provided instead. This means that if someone else does not have the image file locally in the same location you
specified, your world will still be displayed, but using unicode characters instead of textures you chose.</p><p>The tile rendering engine relies on <code>StdDraw</code>. We recommend against using <code>StdDraw</code> commands like <code>setXScale</code>
or <code>setYScale</code> unless you really know what you&#x27;re doing, as you may considerably alter or damage the <em>a e s t h e t i c</em>
of the system otherwise.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="starting-your-program">Starting Your Program<a href="#starting-your-program" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Starting Your Program" title="Direct link to Starting Your Program">​</a></h3><p>Your program will be started by running the <code>main</code> method of the <code>Main</code> class. You will see that this method will render your program and will provide interactivity for you in the future. On top of that, in order to test your world, for 3A, your project must
support <code>getWorldFromInput</code>. Specifically, you should be able to handle an input of the format <code>&quot;N#######S&quot;</code>
where each # is a digit and there can be an arbitrary number of <code>#</code>s. This corresponds to requesting a new world (<code>N</code>),
providing a seed (<code>#</code>s), and then pressing <code>S</code> to indicate that the seed has been completely entered. The logic between your world generation in <code>Main</code> class and <code>getWorldFromInput</code> method should be similar. While you should render your program in <code>Main</code>, you should not do that in <code>getWorldFromInput</code> since this will be used for Autograder.</p><p>Finally, we recommend that you make minimal modifications to the <code>core.Main</code> class. It is a much better idea to delegate
all the work of the program to other classes you will create.</p><p>When your <code>core.Main.main()</code> method is run, your program must display a Main Menu that provides at
LEAST the options to start a new world, load a previously saved world, and quit. The Main Menu should be fully navigable
via the keyboard, using N for &quot;new world&quot;, L for &quot;load world&quot;, and Q for quit. You may include additional options or
methods of navigation if you so choose.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="main-menu_example" src="/assets/images/mainmenu_example-4211dcd5cc734025135873546454e3f2.png" width="840" height="902" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>After pressing N on the keyboard for &quot;new world&quot;, the user should be prompted to enter a &quot;random seed&quot;, which is a long
value of their choosing. This long data type will be used to generate the world randomly (as described later and in lab
12). The UI should show the seed value that the user has entered so far. After the user has pressed the final number in
their seed, they should press S to tell the system that they&#x27;ve entered the entire seed that they want. Your world
generator should be able to handle any positive seed up to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807. There is no defined behavior for
seeds larger than this.</p><p>The behavior of the &quot;Load&quot; command is described later in this specification.</p><p>If the system is being called with <code>core.AutograderBuddy.getWorldFromInput</code>, no menu should be displayed and nothing
should be drawn to the screen. The system should process the given String as if a human user was pressing the
given keys using the <code>main()</code> method. For example, if we
call <code>getWorldFromInput(&quot;N3412S&quot;)</code>, your program should generate a world with seed 3412 and return the
generated 2D tile array. <strong>Note that letters in the input string can be upper or lower case and your engine should be
able to accept either keypress (i.e. &quot;N&quot; and &quot;n&quot; should both initiate the process of world generation).</strong> You should <strong>NOT</strong> render any tiles or play any sound when using <code>getWorldFromInput</code>.</p><p>If you want to allow the user to have additional options, e.g. the ability to pick attributes of their character,
specify world generation parameters, etc., you should create additional options. For example, you might add a fourth
option &quot;S&quot; to the main menu for &quot;select creature and create new world&quot; if you want the user to be able to pick what sort
of creature to play as. These additional options may have arbitrary behavior of your choosing, however, the behavior of
N, L, and Q must be exactly as described in the spec!</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="requirements">Requirements<a href="#requirements" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Requirements" title="Direct link to Requirements">​</a></h3><p>For 3A, you should be able to run <code>Main.main</code> by providing an input String, and have your program create a world,

Grading</a> section below. Note that you should render the world to check your code by writing your own <code>main</code> method, but

also add user interface (UI) elements to your world to make it feel more immersive and informative.</p><p>The requirements for interactivity are as follows:</p><ul><li>The user must be able to control some sort of &quot;avatar&quot; that can moved around using the W, A, S, and D keys. By &quot;avatar&quot;, we just mean some sort of on-screen representation controlled by the
user. For example, in my project, I used an &quot;@&quot; that could be moved around.</li><li>The avatar must be able to interact with the world in some way.</li><li>Your system must be deterministic in that the same sequence of key-presses from the same seed must result in exactly
the same behavior every time. Note that a <code>Random</code> object is guaranteed to output the same random numbers every time.</li><li>In order to support saving and loading, your program will need to create some files in your <code>proj3</code> directory (more
details later in the spec and in the skeleton code). The only files you may create must have the suffix &quot;.txt&quot; (for
example &quot;save-file.txt&quot;). You will get autograder issues if you do not do this.</li></ul><p>Optionally, you may also include game mechanics that allow the user to win or lose.
Aside from these feature requirements, there will be a few technical requirements for your system, described in more
detail below.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ui-user-interface-appearance">UI (User Interface) Appearance<a href="#ui-user-interface-appearance" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to UI (User Interface) Appearance" title="Direct link to UI (User Interface) Appearance">​</a></h3><p>After the user has entered a seed and pressed S, the world should be displayed with a user interface. The user interface
of your project must include:</p><ul><li>A 2D grid of tiles showing the current state of the world.</li><li>A &quot;Heads Up Display&quot; (HUD) that provides additional information that maybe useful to the user. At the bare minimum,
this should include Text that describes the tile currently under the mouse pointer. <strong>This should not be flickering, if it flickers you won&#x27;t be able to receive credit.</strong></li></ul><p>As an example of the bare minimum, the simple interface below displays a grid of tiles and a HUD that displays the
description of the tile under the mouse pointer (click image for higher resolution):</p><p><a target="_blank" href="/assets/files/valid_UI-ffb474b37a5ec00a150fd3c42ff528fc.png"><img loading="lazy" alt="mouseover_example1" src="/assets/images/valid_UI-ffb474b37a5ec00a150fd3c42ff528fc.png" width="2541" height="1594" class="img_ev3q"></a></p><p>You may include additional features if you choose. In the example below (click image for higher resolution), as with the
previous example, the mouse cursor is currently over a wall, so the HUD displays the text &quot;wall&quot; in the top right.
However, this HUD also provides the user with 5 hearts representing the avatar&#x27;s &quot;health&quot;. Note that this world does not
meet the requirements of the spec above, as it is a large erratic cavernous space, as opposed to rooms connected by
hallways.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="/assets/files/UI_example1-ed4ecc2b0bba7363c6a4320261431ecf.png"><img loading="lazy" alt="mouseover_example1" src="/assets/images/UI_example1-ed4ecc2b0bba7363c6a4320261431ecf.png" width="422" height="500" class="img_ev3q"></a></p><p>As an example, the game below (click image for higher resolution) uses the GUI to list additional valid key presses, and

some interesting visuals).</p><p><a target="_blank" href="/assets/files/UI_example2-10283d5ad7432031fc13f568ef82926d.png"><img loading="lazy" alt="mouseover_example2" src="/assets/images/UI_example2-10283d5ad7432031fc13f568ef82926d.png" width="1902" height="1149" class="img_ev3q"></a></p><p>For information about how to specify the location of the HUD, see

The user must be able to move up, left, down, and right using the <code>W</code>, <code>A</code>, <code>S</code>, and <code>D</code> keys, respectively. These keys may also
do additional things, e.g. pushing objects. You may include additional keys in your engine. The avatar should not move
when attempting to move into a wall and the program should not error.</p><p>The system must behave pseudo-randomly. That is, given a certain seed, the same set of key presses must yield the exact
same results!</p><p>In addition to movement keys, if the user enters <code>:Q</code> (note the colon), the program should quit and save. The
description of the saving (and loading) function is described in the next section. <strong>This command must immediately quit
and save</strong>, and should require no further key-presses to complete, e.g. do not ask them if they are sure before quitting.
We will call this single action of quitting and saving at the same time &quot;quit/saving&quot;. This command is not case-sensitive,
so <code>:q</code> should work as well. Additionally, <code>:</code> followed by any other letter should not do anything.</p><p>This project uses <code>StdDraw</code> to handle user input. This results in a couple of important limitations:</p><ul><li><code>StdDraw</code> does not support key combinations. When we say <code>:Q</code>, we mean <code>:</code> followed by <code>Q</code>.</li><li>It can only register key presses that result in a char. This means any unicode character will be fine but keys such as
the arrow keys and escape will not work.</li><li>On some computers, it may not support holding down of keys without some significant modifications; i.e. you can&#x27;t hold
down the e key and keep moving east. If you can figure out how to support holding down of keys in a way that is
compatible with <code>getWorldFromInput</code>, you&#x27;re welcome to do so.</li></ul><p>Because of the requirement that your system must handle String input (via <code>getWorldFromInput</code>), your engine cannot
make use of real time, i.e. your system cannot have any mechanic which depends on a certain amount of time passing in
real life, since that would not be captured in an input string and would not lead to deterministic behavior when using
that string vs. providing input with the keyboard. Keeping track of the number of turns that have elapsed is a perfectly
reasonable mechanic, and might be an interesting thing to include in your world, e.g. maybe the world grows steadily
darker with each step. You&#x27;re welcome to include other key presses like allowing the user to press space bar in
order to wait one turn. The real time behavior is for the autograder. Feel free to ignore real time requirement for 3C and modify your code for that.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="saving-and-loading">Saving and Loading<a href="#saving-and-loading" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Saving and Loading" title="Direct link to Saving and Loading">​</a></h3><p>Sometimes, you&#x27;ll be exploring your world, and you suddenly notice that it&#x27;s time to go to watch a CS 61B lecture. For
times like these, being able to save your progress and load it later, is very handy. Your system must have the ability
to save the state of the world while exploring, as well as to subsequently load the world into the exact state it was in
when last saved.</p><p>Within a running Java program, we use variables to store and load values. Keep in mind that when your program ends, all
the variables will go out of scope. Thus, you will need to persist the state of your program on some files that your
program should create.</p><p>When the user restarts <code>core.Main</code> and presses <code>L</code>, the world should be in <strong>exactly the same state as it was before
the project was terminated</strong>. This state includes the state of the random number generator! More on this in the next
section. In the case that a user attempts to load but there is no previous save, your system should simply quit and the
UI interface should close with no errors produced.</p><p>In the base requirements, the command <code>:Q</code> should save and completely terminate the program. This means an input string
that contains <code>:Q</code> should not have any more characters after it and loading a world would require the program to be run
again with an input string starting with <code>L</code>.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="interacting-with-input-strings">Interacting With Input Strings<a href="#interacting-with-input-strings" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Interacting With Input Strings" title="Direct link to Interacting With Input Strings">​</a></h3><p>Your <code>getWorldFromInput(String input)</code> must be able to handle input strings that include movement.</p><p>For example, the string <code>N543SWWWWAA</code> corresponds to the user creating a world with the seed 543, then moving up four
times, then left twice. If we called <code>getWorldFromInput(&quot;N543SWWWWAA&quot;)</code>, your system would return
a <code>TETile[][]</code> representing the world EXACTLY as it would be if we&#x27;d used <code>main</code> and typed these keys in
manually. Since the system must be deterministic given a seed and a string of inputs, this will allow users to replay
exactly what happened for a given sequence of inputs. This will also be handy for testing out your code, as well as for
our autograder.</p><p><code>getWorldFromInput(String s)</code> must also be able to handle saving and loading in a replay string,
e.g. <code>N25SDDWD:Q</code> would correspond to starting a new world with seed 25, then moving right, right, up, right, then
quit/saving. The method would then return the 2D <code>TETile[][]</code> array at the time of save. If we then started the engine
with the replay string <code>LDDDD</code>, we&#x27;d reload the world we just saved, move right four times, then return the
2D <code>TETile[][]</code> array after the fourth move.</p><p><strong>Your world should not change in any way between saves</strong>, i.e. the same exact <code>TETile[][]</code> should be returned by the
last call to <code>getWorldFromInput</code> for all the following scenarios:</p><ul><li><code>getWorldFromInput(N999SDDDWWWDDD)</code></li><li><code>getWorldFromInput(N999SDDD:Q)</code>, then <code>getWorldFromInput(LWWWDDD)</code></li><li><code>getWorldFromInput(N999SDDD:Q)</code>, then <code>getWorldFromInput(LWWW:Q)</code>, then <code>getWorldFromInput(LDDD:Q)</code></li><li><code>getWorldFromInput(N999SDDD:Q)</code>, then <code>getWorldFromInput(L:Q)</code>, then <code>getWorldFromInput(L:Q)</code>
then <code>getWorldFromInput(LWWWDDD)</code></li></ul><p>we then called <code>getWorldFromInput</code> with input <code>L:Q</code>, we&#x27;d expect the exact same world state to be saved and
returned as <code>TETile[][]</code> as with the previous call where we provided <code>LDDDD</code>.</p><p>You do not need to worry about replay strings that contain multiple saves, i.e. <code>N5SDD:QD:QDD:Q</code> is not considered a
valid replay string, since the program should have terminated before the second <code>:Q</code>. You do not need to worry about
invalid replay strings, i.e. you can assume that every replay string provided by the autograder starts with either <code>N#S</code>
or <code>L</code>, where <code>#</code> represents the user entered seed.</p><p>The return value of the <code>getWorldFromInput</code> method should not depend on whether the input string ends with <code>:Q</code> or
not. The only difference is whether the world state is saved or not as a side effect of the method.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3c-ambition--demos">3C: Ambition &amp; Demos<a href="#3c-ambition--demos" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3C: Ambition &amp; Demos" title="Direct link to 3C: Ambition &amp; Demos">​</a></h2><p>28 points of your project score will be based on features of your choosing, which we call your &quot;ambition score&quot;.

Assign the player a health value, place collectibles that restore health around the map, and create randomly-moving enemies/objects that inflict damage on and receive damage from the player.</p></li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="7-points-secondary-features">7 Points Secondary Features<a href="#7-points-secondary-features" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 7 Points Secondary Features" title="Direct link to 7 Points Secondary Features">​</a></h3><ul><li>Add the ability for the user to &quot;replay&quot; their most recent save, visually displaying all the actions taken since
the last time a new world was created. This must result in the same final state as would occur if the user had loaded
the most recent save. This means that the game should be playable once the replay is complete.</li><li>Add multiple save slots that can be accessed with a new menu option, and a new keyboard shortcut to save to a slot
other than slot 1. You should be careful to still support the default behavior of saving and loading in order to be
consistent with the replay string requirements.</li><li>Add the ability to create a new world without closing and reopening the project, either as a special option you can
press while exploring, or when you reach a &quot;game over&quot; state if you&#x27;ve turned your world into a game.</li><li>Add a menu option to change your avatar&#x27;s appearance to a custom image.</li><li>Add a menu option or randomly determine what the environment/theme of the world will be.</li><li>Add a menu option to change all text in the interface to a different language. English should be the default and there
should be a way to switch it back to English.</li><li>Add support for mouse clicks on the main menu for anything that can be done with a keypress on the main menu.</li><li>Make your engine render images instead of unicode characters.</li><li>Add cool music to your menu and/or exploration interface. Also add sound effects for interactions the avatar makes
with the world.</li><li>Add a minimap somewhere which shows the entire map and the current avatar location. This feature is a lot more
interesting if you also implement a map which is larger than the screen so that you are unable to see the entire map
normally.</li><li>Add ability to rotate the world, i.e. turn the board 90 degrees and adjust movement keys accordingly.</li><li>Add support for movement with mouse clicks on any visible square. You&#x27;ll need to implement some sort of algorithm for
pathfinding.</li><li>Add support for 2 users to interact at the same time. This will require that you have two avatars on screen which can
move around, and they should have separate control schemes.</li><li>Add support for undoing a movement (even moves that occurred in a previous save before the current one was loaded).
Undoing a movement should reset the world back to before the most recent keypress but should add to the replay string
instead of removing a character (i.e. undo command should be logged in the replay string).</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="requirements-summary">Requirements Summary<a href="#requirements-summary" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Requirements Summary" title="Direct link to Requirements Summary">​</a></h2><p>Here is a list of the requirements and restrictions on your project. Please note that this section does not substitute
reading the entire spec since there are a lot of details which are not captured here.</p><ul><li>When using <code>main</code>, your program must have a menu screen that has New World (N), Load (L), and Quit (Q)
options, navigable by the keyboard, which are all not case-sensitive.</li><li>When entering New World, the user should enter an integer seed followed by the S key. Upon pressing S, the world
should be generated and displayed.</li><li>The UI should show the numbers entered so far when the user is giving the seed.</li><li>Must have pseudo-randomly generated worlds/variety in worlds, i.e. the world should be different for every seed.</li><li>All generated worlds must include all the visual features described in 3A above.</li><li>Users must be able to move around in the world using W, A, S, and D keys.</li><li>Users must be able to press &quot;:Q&quot; to quit, and after starting the program up again, the L option on the main menu
should load the world state <strong>exactly as it was before</strong>.</li><li>All random events should be pseudorandom. That is, your program gives deterministic behavior given a seed.</li><li>Users must be able to interact through string inputs using <code>getWorldFromInput</code>, and behavior other than accepting input and drawing to
the screen should be identical to <code>main</code>.</li><li><code>getWorldFromInput</code> must return a <code>TETile[][]</code> array of the world at the time after the last character in the
string is processed.</li><li><code>getWorldFromInput</code> must be able to handle saving and loading, just like <code>main</code>.</li><li>Your program must use our <code>TileEngine</code> and <code>StdDraw</code> for displaying graphics.</li><li>Your program must have a HUD, which displays relevant information somewhere outside the area displaying the
world/tiles.</li><li>HUD must display a description of tile upon hovering over the tile.</li><li>Your program must not use real time. Nothing should be moving if no input is being received. This requirement is <strong>only</strong>
necessary for the autograders; feel free to have real-time dependent features for <strong>3C</strong>.</li><li>Your program must include features that make up 28 points from the Ambition categories, <strong>with at least one primary
feature</strong>.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="submission-and-grading">Submission and Grading<a href="#submission-and-grading" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Submission and Grading" title="Direct link to Submission and Grading">​</a></h2><p>As usual, we&#x27;ll have a grader for this project on Gradescope. <strong>Remember to add your partner as a group member to your

However, you should not use such tools to generate non-trivial methods. We are trying to build your fundamental skills, and leaning on an AI is going to cause you trouble in circumstances where you don&#x27;t have an AI to help, such as exams. Any AI generated code must be cited and explicitly commented as such.&quot;</p><p>For project 3B &amp; 3C, we&#x27;re relaxing this rule and it&#x27;s OK to use large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Bard, Bing, CoPilot, etc. For project 3B &amp; 3C however you want, with the important note that any code generated must be explicitly cited as being AI generated.</p><p>If you want LLMs to be useful for project 3B &amp; 3C, you&#x27;re going to want to give them small tasks. You should think of LLMs as assistant programmers you&#x27;ve hired to help you out on your project — they&#x27;re very fast and sloppy programmers who have little common sense, and they often need very specific directions to be useful.</p><p>If you give high level prompts like write a &quot;write a lighting engine for my game with the code below&quot;, it&#x27;s going to do badly. Prompts like &quot;write a function that takes a Color and a brightness level and returns a new color with the given brightness&quot; are really great use cases for LLMs.</p><p><strong>Important:</strong> LLMs are notorious for confidently stating things that are not true. They don&#x27;t have any actual understanding, and the code they generate may be buggy or even totally garbage.</p><p>Another possible use for LLMs is for debugging! I&#x27;ve occasionally given an LLM some code, described my issue, and it&#x27;s been able to figure out what was wrong.</p></div></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/docs/curriculum-resource/cs61b/projects/proj2c/optional_features"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Project 2B/C Optional Features</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/docs/curriculum-resource/cs61b/projects/proj3/faq"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">FAQ - Project 3 BYOW</div></a></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_bqdL thin-scrollbar theme-doc-toc-desktop"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#faq" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">FAQ</a></li><li><a href="#introduction" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Introduction</a></li><li><a href="#deliverables" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Deliverables</a></li><li><a href="#overview" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Overview</a></li><li><a href="#project-setup" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Project Setup</a><ul><li><a href="#group-repository-setup" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Group Repository Setup</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#skeleton-code" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Skeleton Code</a></li><li><a href="#3a-world-generation" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">3A: World Generation</a><ul><li><a href="#tileset-and-tile-rendering" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Tileset and Tile Rendering</a></li><li><a href="#starting-your-program" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Starting Your Program</a></li><li><a href="#requirements" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Requirements</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#design-document" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Design Document</a><ul><li><a href="#design-document-guidelines" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Design Document Guidelines</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#3b-interactivity" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">3B: Interactivity</a><ul><li><a href="#ui-user-interface-appearance" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">UI (User Interface) Appearance</a></li><li><a href="#ui-behavior" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">UI Behavior</a></li><li><a href="#saving-and-loading" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Saving and Loading</a></li><li><a href="#interacting-with-input-strings" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Interacting With Input Strings</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#3c-ambition--demos" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">3C: Ambition &amp;
