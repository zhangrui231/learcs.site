## Due: Monday, February 12th, 11:59 PM PT 


## [FAQ](faq.md)

Each assignment will have an FAQ linked at the top. You can also access it by adding "/faq" to the end of the URL. The
FAQ for Project 1B is located
[here](faq.md).

Note that this project has limited submission tokens. Please see [Submit to the Autograder](#submit-to-the-autograder) for more details.

## Introduction

In Project 1A, we built `LinkedListDeque61B`. Now we'll see a different
implementation of the `Deque61B` interface that uses a _backing array_, rather
than linked nodes.

By the end of Project 1B, you will...

- Gain an understanding of the implementation of a backing array in
  data structures.
- Have more experience using testing and test-driven development to verify
  the correctness of these data structures.

you should do, but not how.

### Style

As in Project 1A, **we will be enforcing style**. You must follow the
[style guide](../guides/style), or you will be penalized on the
autograder.

You can and should check your style locally with the CS 61B plugin. **We will
not remove the velocity limit for failing to check style.**

### Getting the Skeleton Files

Follow the instructions in the
[Assignment Workflow guide](../guides/assignment-workflow/#assignment-workflow)
to get the skeleton code and open it in IntelliJ. For this project, we will be
working in the **`proj1b`** directory.

You see a `proj1b` directory appear in your repo with the following structure:

```sh
 proj1b
├── src
│   └── Deque61B.java
└── tests
    └── ArrayDeque61BTest.java
```

If you get some sort of error, STOP and either figure it out by carefully
reading the [git WTFs](../guides/git/wtfs) or seek help at OH
or Ed. You'll potentially save yourself a lot of trouble vs. guess-and-check
with git commands. If you find yourself trying to use commands recommended by
Google like `force push`,
[don't](https://twitter.com/heathercmiller/status/526770571728531456).
**Don't use force push, even if a post you found on Stack Overflow says to do it!**

You can also watch Professor Hug's [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tABtNcN5y0A)
about how to get started and this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Squ8TmG5mX0)
if you encounter some git issues.

## Deque: ADT and API

If you need a refresher on `Deque61B`s, refer to the
[Project 1A spec](../proj1a/index.md#deque-adt-and-api)
and the `Deque61B.java` file.

## Creating the File

Start by creating a file called `ArrayDeque61B`. This file should be created
in the `proj1b/src` directory. To do this, right-click on the `src` directory,
navigate to "New -> Java Class", and give it the name `ArrayDeque61B`.

Just like you did in Project 1A We want our `ArrayDeque61B` to be able to hold several different types. To enable this, you should edit the declaration of your class so that it reads:

```java
public class ArrayDeque61B<T>
```

Recall from lecture that it doesn't actually matter if we use `T` or some other
string like `ArrayDeque61B<Glerp>`. However, we recommend using `<T>` for
consistency with other Java code.

We also want to tell Java that every `ArrayDeque61B` is a `Deque61B`, so that users can write code like `Deque61B<String> lld1 = new ArrayDeque61B<>();`. To enable this, change the declaration of your class so that it reads:

```java
public class ArrayDeque61B<T> implements Deque61B<T>
```

Once you've done this step, you'll likely see a squiggly red line under the
entire class declaration. This is because you said that your class implements
an interface, but you haven't actually implemented any of the interface methods
yet.

Hover over the red line with your mouse, and when the
IntelliJ pop-up appears, click the "Implement methods" button. Ensure that all the
methods in the list are highlighted, and click "OK". Now, your class should
be filled with a bunch of empty method declarations. These are the methods that you'll
need to implement for this project!



Lastly, you should create an empty constructor. To do this, add the following
code to your file, leaving the constructor blank for now.

```java
public ArrayDeque61B() {
}
```

Note: You can also generate the constructor by clicking "Code", then "Generate"
then "Constructor", though I prefer the typing the code yourself approach.

Now you're ready to get started!

## `ArrayDeque61B`

As your second deque implementation, you'll build the `ArrayDeque61B` class. This
deque **must** use a Java array as the backing data structure.

You may add any private helper classes or methods in `ArrayDeque61B.java` if you
deem it necessary.

### Constructor

You will need to somehow keep track of what array indices hold the deque's
front and back elements. We **strongly recommend** that you treat your array as
circular for this exercise. In other words, if your front item is at position
`0`, and you `addFirst`, the new front should loop back around to the end of
the array (so the new front item in the deque will be the last item in the
underlying array). This will result in far fewer headaches than non-circular
approaches.

>for more details. In particular, note that
>while the conceptual deque and the array contain the same elements, they do not
>contain them in the same order.
:::
We recommend using the `floorMod(int a, int b)` method from Java's built-in `Math` class to assist you in 
designing a circular approach. Whereas `a % b` might return negative numbers when a is negative, `floorMod(int a, int b)` always return non-negative numbers. In practice, this means that the output will have the same sign as the divisor. Here are a few examples
using the `floorMod(int a, int b)` method:

```java
    int value1 = Math.floorMod(16, 16); // value1 == 0
    int value2 = Math.floorMod(-1, 16); // value2 == 15
    int value3 = Math.floorMod(20, 16); // value3 == 4
```

You can use the `floorMod(int a, int b)` method by adding the following import statement to the top of your file: 
`import java.lang.Math;`.

:::warning
You cannot create an array of generics (e.g. `new T[1000]`) in Java for [reasons beyond the scope of this course](https://openjdk.org/projects/valhalla/). You will instead need to use the syntax `(T[]) new Object[1000]`.

:::task

>The starting size of your backing array **must** be `8`.
:::
### `addFirst` and `addLast`

As before, implement `addFirst` and `addLast`. These two methods **must not**
use looping or recursion. A single add operation must take "constant time,"
that is, adding an element should take approximately the same amount of time no
matter how large the deque is (with one exception). This means that you cannot
use loops that iterate through all / most elements of the deque.

#### Resizing Up

:::warning
We recommend you complete the other methods first, verify that they are working correctly without resizing, and come back to resizing later.
:::

The exception to the "constant time" requirement is when the array fills, and
you need to "resize" to have enough space to add the element. In this case, you
can take "linear time" to resize the array before adding the element.

Correctly resizing your array is very tricky, and will require some deep
thought. Try drawing out various approaches by hand. It may take you quite some
time to come up with the right approach, and we encourage you to debate the big
ideas with your fellow students or TAs. Make sure that your actual
implementation is **by you alone**.

Make sure to resize by a geometric factor.

:::danger

:::

### `get`

Unlike in `LinkedListDeque61B`, this method must take **constant time**.

As before, `get` should return `null` when the index is invalid (too large or
negative). You should disregard the skeleton code comments for `Deque61B.java`
for this case.

:::task
>**After you've written tests and verified that they fail**, implement
>`get`.
:::

### `isEmpty` and `size`

These two methods must take **constant time**. That is, the time it takes to for
either method to finish execution should not depend on how many elements are in
the deque.

:::task
>**Write tests** for the `isEmpty` and `size` methods, and check that
>they fail. Then, implement the methods.
:::

### `toList`

`toList` will continue to be useful to test your `Deque61B`.

Write the `toList` method. The first line of the method should be something
like `List<T> returnList = new ArrayList<>()`. **This is one location where you
are allowed to use a Java data structure.**

:::warning
>Some later methods might seem easy if you use `toList`.
>**You may not call `toList` inside `ArrayDeque61B`**; there is a test that
>checks for this.
:::

:::info
>**Hint** One of the other methods may be helpful for implementing this method.
>
:::

:::task
>Implement `toList`. You are not given tests this time, so you will
>need to write them!
:::


All that's left is to test and implement all the remaining methods. For the
rest of this project, we'll describe our suggested steps at a high level. We
**strongly encourage** you to follow the remaining steps in the order given.
In particular, **write tests before you implement the method's functionality.**
This is called "test-driven development," and helps ensure that you know what
your methods are supposed to do before you do them.



### `removeFirst` and `removeLast`

Lastly, write some tests that test the behavior of `removeFirst` and
`removeLast`, and again ensure that the tests fail.

Do not maintain references to items that are no longer in the deque.

`removeFirst` and `removeLast` **may not** use looping or recursion. Like `addFirst` and `addLast`,
these operations must take \"constant time.\" Refer to the section on writing `addFirst` and `addLast` 
for more information on what this means.


#### Resizing Down

The amount of memory that your program uses at any given time must be
proportional to the number of items. For example, if you add 10,000 items to
the deque, and then remove 9,999 items, you shouldn't still be using an array
that can hold 10,000 items. For arrays of length 16 or more, your usage factor
should always be at least 25%. This means that before performing a remove
operation, if the number of elements in the array is at or under 25% the
length of the array, you should resize the array down. For arrays
length 15 or less, your usage factor can be arbitrarily low.

:::danger
>We, again, **do not** recommend using `arraycopy` with a circular
>implementation. If you followed our advice above to use a `for` loop to resize
>up, resizing down should look **very similar** to resizing up (perhaps a helper
>method?).
:::

:::task
>**After you've written tests and verified that they fail**, implement
>`removeFirst` and `removeLast`.
:::

:::danger
>For the intended experience, follow these steps in order. If you do something
>else and ask us for help, we will refer you back to these steps.
:::


### `getRecursive`

Although we are not using a linked list anymore for this project, it is still required to implement this method to keep consistent with our interface.
This method technically shouldn't be in the interface, but it's here to make testing nice. You can just use this code block for it:

```java
    @Override
    public T getRecursive(int index) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("No need to implement getRecursive for proj 1b");
    }
```

:::task
"Implement" `getRecursive`.
:::


### Writing Tests

Refer to the [Project 1A spec](../proj1a/index.md#writing-tests) for
a review of how to write tests. Similar to Project 1A, you will be scored on
the coverage of your unit tests for Project 1B. You might find some of your
tests from Project 1A to be reusable in this project; don't be afraid to
copy them over!


### Suggestions

- Try to get everything working for a fixed-size array first. This would be good point to start to familiarize yourself.
- Once you are confident working solution for a fixed-size array, try resizing - consider having a helper method for it!
- **DO NOT** modify `Deque61B` interface


### Submit to the Autograder

Once you've written local tests and passed them, try submitting to the
autograder. You may or may not pass everything.

- If you fail any of the coverage tests, it means that there is a case that
  your local tests did not cover. The autograder test name and the test
  coverage component will give you hints towards the missing case.
- If you fail a correctness test, this means that there is a case that your
  local tests did not cover, despite having sufficient coverage for flags.
  This is **expected**. Coverage flags are an approximation! They also do not
  provide describe every single behavior that needs to be tested, nor do they
  guarantee that you assert everything. [Here](./flags.md) is a list of them!
- If you fail any of the timing tests, it means that your implementation does
  not meet the timing constraints described above.
- You will have a token limit of 4 tokens every 24 hours. **We will not reinstate tokens for failing to add/commit/push your code, run style, etc.**
- You may find messages in the autograder response that look something like this: `WARNING: A terminally deprecated method in java.lang.System has been called`. You can safely ignore any line tagged as a `WARNING`.

### Scoring

This project, similar to Project 0, is divided into individual components, each
of which you must implement _completely correctly_ to receive credit.

1. **Adding (25%)**: Correctly implement `addFirst`, `addLast`, and `toList`.
2. **`isEmpty`, `size` (5%)**: Correctly implement `isEmpty` and `size` with
   add methods working.
3. **`get` (10%)**: Correctly implement `get`.
4. **Removing (30%)**: Correctly implement `removeFirst` and `removeLast`.
5. **Memory (20%)**: Correctly implement resizing so that you do not use
   too much memory.

Additionally, there is a **test coverage (10%)** component. We will run your
tests against a staff solution, and check how many scenarios and edge cases are
tested. You can receive partial credit for this component. [Here](./flags.md) is a list of them!
