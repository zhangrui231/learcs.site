## [FAQ](faq.md)

Each assignment will have an FAQ linked at the top. You can also access it by adding "/faq" to the end of the URL. The
FAQ for Project 2A is located
[here](faq.md).

## Introduction

In this project, we will build a browser based tool for exploring the history of word usage in English texts. We have
provided the front end code (in Javascript and HTML) that collects user inputs and displays outputs. Your Java code will
be the back end for this tool, accepting input and generating appropriate output for display.

A video introduction to this project can be
found below (or [at this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ri9BzE723QA&list=PL8FaHk7qbOD7-899l1hKEd5aICB9u1wrm&index=1)).

</p>

To support this tool, you will write a series of Java packages that will allow for data analysis. Along the way we'll
get lots of experience with different useful data structures. The early part of the project (proj2a) will start by
telling you exactly what functions to write and classes to create. The later part (proj2b) will be more open to your
own design.

You can view the staff solution to the project at [ngordnet.datastructur.es](https://ngordnet.datastructur.es).

## Getting Started

To get started, use `git pull skeleton main` as usual.

You'll also need to download the Project 2 data files (not provided via GitHub for space reasons).

:::task
>Download the data files [at this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xGTZqCo5maiZjA307OPocmKDOTYlJXnz/view?usp=sharing).
>
>You should unzip this file into the proj2 directory such that the `data` folder is at the same level as the `src`
and `static` folders.
>
>- [How to unzip folders on Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/zip-and-unzip-files-f6dde0a7-0fec-8294-e1d3-703ed85e7ebc#:~:text=To%20unzip%20files,folder%20to%20a%20new%20location.)

:::
Once you are done with this step, your `proj2a` directory should look like this:

```sh
proj2a
├── data
│   ├── ngrams
│   └── wordnet
├── src
├── static
├── tests
```

Note that we've set up hidden [`.gitignore`](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/) files
in the skeleton code so that Git will avoid uploading these data files. This is intentional.

:::danger
Uploading the data files to GitHub will result in a lot of headaches for everybody, so please don't mess with any files called `.gitignore`. If you need to work on multiple machines, you should download the zip file once for each machine.
:::

If `NgordnetQuery` doesn't compile, make sure you are using Java version 15 (preview) or higher (preferably 17+).

A video guide to setting up your computer for this project can be found [at this link](https://youtu.be/8uIt7pXua6Y).
Note that some files/filenames may be slightly different; in particular, the `hugbrowsermagic` directory in the
video is now just called `browser` in your skeleton files.

## Building An NGrams Viewer

The [Google Ngram dataset](http://storage.googleapis.com/books/ngrams/books/datasetsv3.html) provides many terabytes of
information about the historical frequencies of all observed words and phrases in English (or more precisely all
observed [ngrams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram)). Google provides
the [Google Ngram Viewer on the web](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=global+warming%2Cto+the+moon&year_start=1800&year_end=2019&corpus=en-2019&smoothing=0)
, allowing users to visualize the relative historical popularity of words and phrases. For example, the link above plots
the **weighted popularity history** of the phrases "global warming" (a 2gram) and "to the moon" (a 3gram).

In Project 2A, you will be build a version of this tool that only handles 1grams. In other words, you'll only be able to
handle individual words. We'll only use a small subset (around 300 megabytes) of the full 1grams dataset, as larger
datasets will require more sophisticated techniques that are out of scope for this class.

## TimeSeries

A `TimeSeries` is a special purpose extension of the existing `TreeMap` class where the key type parameter is
always `Integer`, and the value type parameter is always `Double`. Each key will correspond to a year, and each value a
numerical data point for that year. You can find the `TreeMap` API from [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/TreeMap.html) to see which methods are available to you.

For example, the following code would create a `TimeSeries` and associate the year 1992 with the value 3.6 and 1993 with 9.2.

```java
TimeSeries ts = new TimeSeries();
ts.put(1992,3.6);
ts.put(1993,9.2);
```

The `TimeSeries` class provides some additional utility methods to the `TreeMap` class, which it extends.

:::task
>Fill out the `TimeSeries` class (located in the `src/ngrams/TimeSeries.java` file) according to
>the API provided in the file. Be sure to read the comments above each method.
:::

:::warning
>For an example of how `TimeSeries` objects are used, check out the test named `testFromSpec()` in the `TimeSeriesTest.java`
file that we've provided.
>This test creates a `TimeSeries` of cat and dog populations and then computes their sum. Note
that there is no value for 1993 because that year does not appear in either `TimeSeries`.

You may not add additional public methods to this class. You're welcome to add additional private methods.

### TimeSeries Tips

- `TimeSeries` objects should have no instance variables. A `TimeSeries` is-a `TreeMap`. That means your `TimeSeries`
  class also has access to all methods that a TreeMap has;
  see [the TreeMap API](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/TreeMap.html).
- **Several methods require that you compare the data of two `TimeSeries`. You should not have any code which fills in a zero if a year or value is unavailable.**
- The provided `TimeSeriesTest` class provides a simple test of the `TimeSeries` class. Feel free to add your own tests.
  - Note that the unit tests we gave you **do not** evaluate the correctness of the `dividedBy` method.
- You'll notice in `testFromSpec()` that we did not directly compare `expectedTotal` with `totalPopulation.data()`. This
  is because doubles are prone to rounding errors, especially after division operations (for reasons that you will learn
  in 61C). Thus, `assertThat(x).isEqualTo(y)` may unexpectedly
  return false when `x` and `y` are doubles. Instead, you should use `assertThat(x).isWithin(1E-10).of(y)`, which returns
  true as long as `x` and `y` are within $10^{-10}$ of each other.
- You may assume that the `dividedBy` operation never divides by zero.

## NGramMap

The `NGramMap` class will provide various convenient methods for interacting with Google's NGrams dataset. This task is
more open-ended and challenging than the creation of the `TimeSeries` class. As with `TimeSeries`, you'll be filling in
the methods of an existing `NGramMap.java` file. **NGramMap should not extend any class.**

If you call a method that returns a `TimeSeries`, and there is no available data for the given method call, you should return an empty `TimeSeries`. For example, `ngm.weightHistory("asdfasdf")` should return a `TimeSeries` with nothing in it, since `"asdfasdf"` is not a word in the dataset. As another example, `ngm.countHistory("adopt", 1400, 1410)` should also return a `TimeSeries` with nothing in it,
since `"adopt"` has no data during those years.

:::task
>Fill out the `NGramMap` class (located in the `src/ngrams/NGramMap.java` file) according to
>the API provided in the file. Once again, be sure to read the comments above each method.
:::

:::warning
>For an example of an `NGramMap` at work, the `testOnLargeFile()` in `NGramMapTest` creates an `NGramMap` from the
>`top_14377_words.csv` and `total_counts.csv` files (described below). It then performs various operations related to the
>occurrences of the words \"fish\" and \"dog\" in the period between 1850 and 1933.

You may not add additional public methods to this class. You're welcome to add additional private methods.

### Input File Formats

The NGram dataset comes in two different file types. The first type is a "words file". Each line of a words file
provides tab separated information about the history of a particular word in English during a given year.

    airport     2007    175702  32788
    airport     2008    173294  31271
    request     2005    646179  81592
    request     2006    677820  86967
    request     2007    697645  92342
    request     2008    795265  125775
    wandered    2005    83769   32682
    wandered    2006    87688   34647
    wandered    2007    108634  40101
    wandered    2008    171015  64395

The first entry in each row is the word. The second entry is the year. The third entry is the number of times that the
word appeared in any book that year. The fourth entry is the number of distinct sources that contain that word. **Your
program should ignore this fourth column.** For example, from the text file above, we can observe that the word "wandered"
appeared 171,015 times during the year 2008, and these appearances were spread across 64,395 distinct texts. For this
project, we never care about the fourth entry (total number of volumes).

The other type of file is a "counts file". Each line of a counts file provides comma separated information about the
total corpus of data available for each calendar year.

    1470,984,10,1
    1472,117652,902,2
    1475,328918,1162,1
    1476,20502,186,2
    1477,376341,2479,2

The first entry in each row is the year. The second is the total number of words recorded from all texts that year. The
third number is the total number of pages of text from that year. The fourth is the total number of distinct sources
from that year. Your program should ignore the third and fourth columns. For example, we see that Google has exactly one
English language text from the year 1470, and that it contains 984 words and 10 pages. For the purposes of our project
the 10 and the 1 are irrelevant.

You may wonder why one file is tab separated and the other is comma separated. I didn't do it, Google did. Luckily, this
difference won't be too hard to handle.

### NGramMap Tips

There is a lot to think about for this part of the project. We're trying to mimic the situation in the real world where
you have some big open-ended problem and have to figure out the approach from scratch. This can be intimidating! It will
likely take some time and a lot of experimentation to figure out how to proceed. To help keep things from being too
difficult, we've at least provided a list of methods to implement. Keep in mind that in the real world (and in proj2b
and proj3), even the list of methods will be your choice.

Your code should be fast enough that you can create an `NGramMap` using `top_14377_words.csv`. Loading should take less than
60 seconds (maybe a bit longer on an older computer). If your computer has enough memory, you should also be able to
load `top_49887_words.csv`.

- The bulk of your work in this class will be implementing the constructor. You'll need to parse through the provided
  data files and store this data in a data structure (or structures) of your choice.
  - This choice is important, since picking the right data structure(s) can make your life a lot easier when
    implementing the rest of the methods. Thus, we recommend taking a look at the rest of the methods first to help
    you decide what data structure might be best; then, begin implementing the constructor.
- Avoid using a HashMap or TreeMap as
  an [actual type argument](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1j2vivowiaZWepIjUoWj6Cx3CdJiyuYslxkg8GsT8kxM/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000&slide=id.g631db3c57_38)
  for your maps. This is usually a sign that what you actually want is a custom defined type. In other words, if your
  instance variables include a nested mapping that looks like `HashMap<blah, HashMap<blah, blah>>`, then a `TimeSeries`
  or some other class you come up with might be useful to keep in mind instead.
- We have not taught you how to read files in Java. We recommend using the `In` class. The official documentation can be
  found [here](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/javadoc/In.html). However, you're welcome to use whatever
  technique you'd like that you learn about online. We provide an example class `FileReaderDemo.java` that gives
  examples of how to use `In`.
- If you use `In`, don't use `readAllLines` or `readAllStrings`. These methods are slow. Instead, read inputs one chunk
  at a time. See `src/main/FileReaderDemo.java` for an example.
  - Additionally, to check if there are any lines left in a file, you should use `hasNextLine` (and not `isEmpty`).
- Our provided tests only cover some methods, but some methods are only tested on a very large file. You will need to
  write additional tests.
  - Rather than using one of the large input files (e.g. `top_14377_words.csv`), we recommend starting with one of the
    smaller input files, either `very_short.csv` or `words_that_start_with_q.csv`.
- **Like in TimeSeries, you should not have any code which fills in a zero if a value is unavailable.**
- If it helps speed up your code, you can assume year arguments are between 1400 and 2100. These variables are stored as constants `MIN_YEAR` and `MAX_YEAR` in the `TimeSeries` class.
- `NGramMap` should not extend any other class.
- Your methods should be simple! If you pick the right data structures, the methods should be relatively short.
- If the word is invalid, return an empty `TimeSeries`.

## HistoryTextHandler

In this final part of Project 2A, we'll do a bit of software engineering to set up a web server that can handle
NgordnetQueries. While this content isn't strictly related to
data structures, it is incredibly important to be able to take projects and deploy them for real world use.

**Note:** You should only begin this part when you are fairly confident that `TimeSeries` and `NGramMap` are working properly.

1.  In your web browser, open up the `ngordnet_2a.html` file in the `static` folder. You can do this from your finder
    menu in your operating system, or by right-clicking on the `ngordnet_2a.html` in IntelliJ, clicking "Open in", then
    "Browser". You can use whatever browser you want, though TAs will be most familiar with Chrome. You'll see a web
    browser based interface that will ultimately (when you're done with the project) allow a user to enter a list of
    words and display a visualization.

2.  Try entering "cat, dog" into the "words" box, then click `History (Text)`. You'll see that nothing useful shows up.
    Optional: If you open the developer tools in your web browser (see Google for how to do this), you'll see an error
    that looks like either "CONNECTION_REFUSED" or "INVALID_URL". The problem is that the Javascript tries to access a
    server to generate the results, but there is no web server running that can handle the request to see the history of
    cat and dog.

3.  Open the `main.Main` class. This class's `main` method first creates a `NgordnetServer` object. The API for this
    class is as follows: First, we call `startUp` on the `NgordnetServer` object, then we "register" one or
    more `NgordnetQueryHandler` using the `register` command. The precise details here are beyond the scope of our class.

    The basic idea is that when you call `hns.register("historytext", new DummyHistoryTextHandler(ngm))`, an object of
    type `DummyHistoryTextHandler` is created that will handle any clicks to the `History (Text)` button.

4.  Try running the `main.Main` class. In the terminal output in IntelliJ you should see the
    line: `INFO org.eclipse.jetty.server.Server - Started...`, which means the server started correctly. Now open the
    `ngordnet_2a.html` file again, enter "cat, dog" again, then click `History (Text)`. This time, you should see a
    message that says:

         You entered the following info into the browser:
         Words: [cat, dog]
         Start Year: 2000
         End Year: 2020

5.  Now open `main.DummyHistoryTextHandler`, you'll see a `handle` method. This is called whenever the user
    clicks the `History (Text)` button. The expected behavior should instead be that when the user clicks `History (Text)` for the prompt above, the
    following text should be displayed:

```
cat: {2000=1.71568475416827E-5, 2001=1.6120939684412677E-5, 2002=1.61742010630623E-5, 2003=1.703155141714967E-5, 2004=1.7418408946715716E-5, 2005=1.8042211615010028E-5, 2006=1.8126126955841936E-5, 2007=1.9411504094739293E-5, 2008=1.9999492186117545E-5, 2009=2.1599428349729816E-5, 2010=2.1712564894218663E-5, 2011=2.4857238078766228E-5, 2012=2.4198586699546612E-5, 2013=2.3131865569578688E-5, 2014=2.5344693375481996E-5, 2015=2.5237182007765998E-5, 2016=2.3157514119191215E-5, 2017=2.482102172595473E-5, 2018=2.3556758130732888E-5, 2019=2.4581322086049953E-5}
dog: {2000=3.127517699525712E-5, 2001=2.99511426723737E-5, 2002=3.0283458650225453E-5, 2003=3.1470761877596034E-5, 2004=3.2890514515432536E-5, 2005=3.753038415155302E-5, 2006=3.74430614362125E-5, 2007=3.987077208249744E-5, 2008=4.267197824115907E-5, 2009=4.81026086549733E-5, 2010=5.30567576173992E-5, 2011=6.048536820577008E-5, 2012=5.179787485962082E-5, 2013=5.0225599367200654E-5, 2014=5.5575537540090384E-5, 2015=5.44261096781696E-5, 2016=4.805214145459557E-5, 2017=5.4171157785607686E-5, 2018=5.206751570646653E-5, 2019=5.5807040409297486E-5}
```

To pass on the autograder, the formatting of the output must match exactly.

- All lines of text, including the last line, should end in a new line character.
- All whitespace and punctuation (commas, braces, colons) should follow the example above.

These numbers represent the **weighted popularity histories** of the words cat and dog in the given years. Due to rounding
errors, your numbers may not be exactly the same as shown above. Your format should be exactly as shown above:
specifically the word, followed by a colon, followed by a space, followed by a string representation of the
appropriate `TimeSeries` where key-value pairs are given as a comma-separated list inside curly braces, with an equals
sign between the key and values. Note that you don't need to write any code to generate the string representation of
each `TimeSeries`, you can just use the `toString()` method.

Now it's time to implement the HistoryText button!

### HistoryTextHandler Tips

- The constructor for `HistoryTextHandler` should be of the following form: `public HistoryTextHandler(NGramMap map)`.
- Use the `DummyHistoryTextHandler.java` as a guide, pattern matching where appropriate. Being able to tinker with
  example code and bend it to your will is an incredibly important real world skill. Experiment away, don't be afraid to
  break something!
- **For Project 2A**, you can ignore the `k` instance variable of `NgordnetQuery`.
- Use the `.toString()` method built into the `TimeSeries` class that gets inherited from `TreeMap`.
- For your `HistoryTextHandler` to be able to do something useful, it's going to need to be able to access the data
  stored in your `NGramMap`. **DO NOT MAKE THE NGRAM MAP INTO A STATIC VARIABLE!** This is known as a "global variable"
  and is rarely the appropriate solution for any problem. Hint: Your `HistoryTextHandler` class can have a constructor.
- If word is invalid, think about how `NGramMap` is handling this situation.

## HistoryHandler

The text based history from the previous section is not useful for much other than auto-grading your work. Actually using
our tool to discover interesting things will require visualization.

The `main.PlotDemo` provides example code that uses your `NGramMap` to generate a visual plot showing the
weighted popularity history of the words cat and dog between 1900 and 1950. Try running it. If your `NGramMap` class is correct,
you should see a very long string printed to your console that might look something like:

    iVBORw0KGg...

This string is a base 64 encoding of an image file. To visualize it, go to [codebeautify.org](https://codebeautify.org/base64-to-image-converter).
Copy and paste this entire string into the
website, and you should see a plot similar to the one shown below:

![decoded base 64](/img/cs61b/default_base64.png)

What's going on here? The string your code printed IS THE IMAGE. Keep in mind that any data can be represented as a
string of bits. This website knows how to decode this string into the corresponding image, using a predefined standard.

If you look at the plotting library, this code relies on the `ngordnet.Plotter.generateTimeSeriesChart` method, which
takes two arguments. The first is a list of strings, and the second is a `List<TimeSeries>`. The `TimeSeries` are all
plotted in a different color, and each is assigned the label given in the list of strings. Both lists must be of the
same length (since the ith string is the label for the ith time series).

The `ngordnet.Plotter.generateTimeSeriesChart` method returns an object of type `XYChart`. This object can in turn
either be converted into base 64 by the `ngordnet.Plotter.encodeChartAsString` method, or can be displayed to the screen
directly by `ngordnet.Plotter.displayChart`.

In your web browser, again open up the `ngordnet_2a.html` file in the `static` folder. With your `main.Main`
class running, enter "cat, dog" into the "words" box, then click "history". You'll see the strange image below:

![parabola and sinusoid](/img/cs61b/default_history_plot.png)

You'll note that the code is not plotting the history of cat and dog, but rather a parabola and a sinusoid. If you
open `DummyHistoryHandler`, you'll see why.

:::task
>Create a new file called `HistoryHandler.java` that takes the given `NgordnetQuery` and returns a String that contains
>a base-64 encoded image of the appropriate plot.
>
>Then, modify the `Main.java` so that your `HistoryHandler` is called when someone clicks the `History` button.
:::

### HistoryHandler Tips

- The constructor for `HistoryHandler` should be of the following form: `public HistoryHandler(NGramMap map)`.
- Just like before, use `DummyHistoryHandler.java` as a guide. As mentioned in the previous section, we really want you
  to learn the skill of tinkering with complex library code to get the behavior you want.

## Deliverables and Scoring

You are responsible for implementing four classes:

- **TimeSeries (30%)**: Correctly implement `TimeSeries.java`.
- **NGramMap Count (20%)**: Correctly implement `countHistory()` and `totalCountHistory()` in `NGramMap.java`.
- **NGramMap Weight (30%)**: Correctly implement `weightHistory()` and `summedWeightHistory()` in `NGramMap.java`.
- **HistoryTextHandler (10%)**: Correctly implement `HistoryTextHandler.java`.
- **HistoryHandler (10%)**: Correctly implement `HistoryHandler.java`.
