## What is Beacon?

Rather than using bCourses, we will be using our own custom learning management
system called Beacon at
[beacon.datastructur.es](https://sp24.beacon.datastructur.es/). You can use Beacon
to keep track of your grades and late assignments, and you will also use it to
establish partnerships.

Lab 1 will walk you through getting started with Beacon. This guide will detail
the different tabs in Beacon and how to effectively use the system.

As we continuously work to improve Beacon, we will announce on Ed and update
this guide when we introduce new features.

## The Beacon Home Page

On the home page, you will see your name, your Berkeley email address, and
Github username. You should make sure all the information is correct, otherwise
some course functionalities will not work for you. If any of the information is
incorrect, please make a private post on Ed asking us to fix these details for
you.

Most importantly, verify that the email address you see on Beacon is the same
email used in your Gradescope account. Some assignments and extra credit
opportunities have you fill out Google forms, which record the email account
you are logged in with. Whenever you fill such form, make sure you are logged
in from the address on specified Beacon. If you change your Berkeley email
address for whatever reason during the semester, please let us know. If there
is a mismatch between your Beacon email and your Gradescope/Google form email,
your grades may not be accurate, so please be aware of this.

<!-- You will also find on this page the Discord username you should use to log into
our Discord servers for lab sections and office hours. See our
[Discord Guide](discord-guide) for more information. Note that these Discord
usernames will not be enforced for the first few weeks of class. -->

## The Grades Tab

Here you will see all the points you earned for the different assignments and
extra credit opportunities. Remember that CS 61B is not curved, so by making
conjectures about your performance in future assignments together with the data
on this tab, you can check what letter grade corresponds to your total points.
You can learn more about grading bins in our [Course Info page.](../../../policies/index.md).

The grades tab gets data periodically from Gradescope. Thus, it may not be
immediately updated whenever you submit an assignment to Gradescope. You can
expect the grades tab to update every 24 hours.

The Grades tab on Beacon is the final source of truth for your grades. If your
grade on Beacon does not match what you see on Gradescope, please let us know.

<!-- ## The Partnerships Tab

In this tab, you will see information about all the partnerships you have
established. In Spring 2021 students are allowed to optionally work with a
partner on lab assignments, and are required to work with a partner on
Project 3. You can learn more about the partnerships tab and partnerships in
[the Partnerships Guide.](partnerships) -->

## The Groups Tab

For some projects, you will be working on the assignment with a partner. Your groups for these assignments will be displayed under the "Groups" tab. Use this tab to find your partner(s) and shared group repository.

## The Extensions Tab

The [extensions tab on Beacon](https://sp24.beacon.datastructur.es//extensions/) is
where you'll request extensions. To view the extensions policy, go to the [course info page](../../../policies/index.md#lateness). Additionally, visit our guide on requesting an extension [here](../../../policies/extensions/index.md).
