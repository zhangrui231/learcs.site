# Week 1 Practice Problems - CS50x 2023

These problems assume that you have already set up your CS50 Codespace in [Lab 1](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/problems/labs/1/). Be sure to complete that before attempting these problems.

In addition to this week’s lab and problem set, you’re welcome to try any of these (optional!) practice problems:

-   [Debug](debug.md), for becoming familiar with C syntax and debugging programs
-   [Half](half.md), for practice creating a function
-   [Prime](prime.md), for practice using `for` loops
