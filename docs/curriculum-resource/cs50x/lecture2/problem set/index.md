## What to Do

1.  Log into [cs50.dev](https://cs50.dev/) using your GitHub account.
2.  Run `update50` in your codespace’s terminal window to ensure your codespace is up-to-date and, when prompted, click **Rebuild now**
3.  Submit [Hello](hello.md)
4.  Submit one of:
    -   [this version of Mario](less.md) if feeling less comfortable
    -   [this version of Mario](more.md) if feeling more comfortable
5.  Submit one of:
    -   [Cash](cash.md) if feeling less comfortable

-   If you see any errors when compiling your code with `make`, focus first on fixing the very first error you see, scrolling up as needed. If unsure what it means, try asking `help50` for help. For instance, if trying to compile `hello`, and

    is yielding errors, try running
