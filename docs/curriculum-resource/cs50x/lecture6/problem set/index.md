## Advice

-   Try out any of David’s programs from [Week 5](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/psets/weeks/5/).
-   If you see any errors when compiling your code with `make`, focus first on fixing the very first error you see, scrolling up as needed. If unsure what it means, try asking `help50` for help. For instance, if trying to compile `speller`, and

    is yielding errors, try running

    instead!
