3.  Submit [Hello](hello.md)
4.  Submit one of:
    -   [this version of Mario](mario less.md) if feeling less comfortable

## [Advice](#advice)

-   Try out any of David’s programs from class via [Week 1](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/weeks/1/)’s source code.
-   See CS50’s [style guide for C](https://cs50.readthedocs.io/style/c/) for tips on how to improve your code’s style.
-   If you see any errors when compiling your code with `make`, focus first on fixing the very first error you see, scrolling up as needed. If unsure what it means, try asking `help50` for help. For instance, if trying to compile `hello`, and
    
    is yielding errors, try running
    
    instead!
