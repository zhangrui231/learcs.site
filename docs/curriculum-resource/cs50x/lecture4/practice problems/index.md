-   [Recursive `atoi`](atoi.md), for practice creating recursive functions
-   [Average Temperatures](temps.md), for practice working with `struct`s and sorting algorithms
-   [Max](max.md), for practice passing arrays to functions and finding maximum values
-   [Snackbar](snackbar.md), for practice using `struct`s and writing a linear search algorithm
