# Problem Set 3 - CS50x 2023

## What to Do

1.  Log into [cs50.dev](https://cs50.dev/) using your GitHub account
2.  Run `update50` in your codespace’s terminal window to ensure your codespace is up-to-date and, when prompted, click **Rebuild now**
3.  Submit [Plurality](plurality.md)
4.  Submit one of:
    -   [Runoff](runoff.md), if feeling less comfortable
    -   [Tideman](tideman.md), if feeling more comfortable

If you submit both Runoff and Tideman, we’ll record the higher of your two scores.

## When to Do It

## Advice

-   Try out any of David’s programs from class via [Week 3](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/psets/weeks/3/)’s sandboxes.
-   If you see any errors when compiling your code with `make`, focus first on fixing the very first error you see, scrolling up as needed. If unsure what it means, try asking `help50` for help. For instance, if trying to compile `plurality`, and

    is yielding errors, try running

    instead!
