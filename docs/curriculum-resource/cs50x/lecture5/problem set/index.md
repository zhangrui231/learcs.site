# Problem Set 4 - CS50x 2023

## What to Do

1.  Log into [cs50.dev](https://cs50.dev/) using your GitHub account
2.  Run `update50` in your codespace’s terminal window to ensure your codespace is up-to-date and, when prompted, click **Rebuild now**
3.  Submit one of:
    -   [this version of Filter](less.md) if feeling less comfortable
    -   [this version of Filter](more.md) if feeling more comfortable
4.  Submit one of:
    -   [Recover](recover.md)
    -   [Reverse](reverse.md)

If you submit both versions of Filter, we’ll record the higher of your two scores.

## When to Do It

## Advice

-   Try out any of David’s programs from [Week 4](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/psets/weeks/4/).
-   If you see any errors when compiling your code with `make`, focus first on fixing the very first error you see, scrolling up as needed. If unsure what it means, try asking `help50` for help. For instance, if trying to compile `filter`, and

    is yielding errors, try running

    instead!
