# Problem Set 7 - CS50x 2023

Collaboration on problem sets is not permitted except to the extent that you may ask classmates and others for help so long as that help does not reduce to another doing your work for you, per the course’s policy on [academic honesty](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/psets/syllabus/#academic-honesty).

The staff conducts random audits of submissions to CS50x. Students found to be in violation of this policy will be removed from the course. Students who have already completed CS50x, if found to be in violation, will have their CS50 Certificate permanently revoked.

## What to Do

Be sure you have completed [Lab 7](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/psets/labs/7/) before beginning this problem set.

1.  Log into [cs50.dev](https://cs50.dev/) using your GitHub account
2.  Run `update50` in your codespace’s terminal window to ensure your codespace is up-to-date and, when prompted, click **Rebuild now**
3.  Submit [Movies](movies.md)
