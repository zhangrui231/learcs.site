# Week 2 Practice Problems - CS50x 2023

In addition to this week’s lab and problem set, you’re welcome to try any of these (optional!) practice problems:

-   [Hours](hours.md), for practice with arrays, passing arrays as parameters to a function, integer division and type casting
-   [N0 V0w3ls](no-vowels.md), for practice with strings, command-line arguments, and writing an entire program from scratch
-   [Password](password.md), for practice iterating through a string, using the `ctype` library, and using Boolean variables
