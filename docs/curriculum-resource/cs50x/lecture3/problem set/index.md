# Problem Set 2 - CS50x 2023

## What to Do

1.  Log into [cs50.dev](https://cs50.dev/) using your GitHub account
2.  Run `update50` in your codespace’s terminal window to ensure your codespace is up-to-date and, when prompted, click **Rebuild now**
3.  Submit [Readability](readability.md)
4.  Submit one of:
    -   [Bulbs](bulbs.md), if feeling less comfortable
    -   [Caesar](caesar.md), if feeling less comfortable
    -   [Substitution](substitution.md), if feeling more comfortable
    -   [Wordle50](wordle50.md), if feeling more comfortable

If you submit more than one of Bulbs, Caesar, Substitution, or Wordle50, we’ll record the single highest of your scores among those problems.

## Advice

-   Try out any of David’s programs from class via [Week 2](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/psets/weeks/2/)’s examples.
-   To see the manual pages for C functions, visit [manual.cs50.io](https://manual.cs50.io/).
-   If you see any errors when compiling your code with `make`, focus first on fixing the very first error you see, scrolling up as needed. If unsure what it means, try asking `help50` for help. For instance, if trying to compile `readability`, and

    is yielding errors, try running

    instead!
