_Due by 11:59pm on Thursday, March 7_

## Instructions

Download [hw05.zip](/resource/cs61a/hw05.zip). Inside the archive, you will find a file called [hw05.py](https://cs61a.org//hw/hw05/hw05.py), along with a copy of the `ok` autograder.

**Submission:** When you are done, submit the assignment by uploading all code files you've edited to Gradescope. You may submit more than once before the deadline; only the final submission will be scored. Check that you have successfully submitted your code on Gradescope. See [Lab 0](https://cs61a.org/lab/lab00#task-c-submitting-the-assignment) for more instructions on submitting assignments.

**Using Ok:** If you have any questions about using Ok, please refer to [this guide.](https://cs61a.org/articles/using-ok)

**Readings:** You might find the following references useful:

### Q1: Infinite Hailstone

Write a generator function that yiels the elements of the hailstone sequence starting at number `n`. After reaching the end of the hailstone sequence, the generator should yield the value 1 indefinitely.

Here's a quick reminder of how the hailstone sequence is defined:

1.  Pick a positive integer `n` as the start.
2.  If `n` is even, divide it by 2.
3.  If `n` is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
4.  Continue this process until `n` is 1.

Try to write this generator function recursively. If you're stuck, you can first try writing it iteratively and then seeing how you can turn that implementation into a recursive one.

> **Hint:** Since `hailstone` returns a generator, you can `yield from` a call to `hailstone`!

```
def hailstone(n):
    """Q1: Yields the elements of the hailstone sequence starting at n.
       At the end of the sequence, yield 1 infinitely.

    >>> hail_gen = hailstone(10)
    >>> [next(hail_gen) for _ in range(10)]
    [10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1]
    >>> next(hail_gen)
    1
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"

```

Use Ok to test your code:

```
python3 ok -q hailstone
```

  

### Q2: Merge

Write a generator function `merge` that takes in two infinite generators `a` and `b` that are in increasing order without duplicates and returns a generator that has all the elements of both generators, in increasing order, without duplicates.

```
def merge(a, b):
    """Q2:
    >>> def sequence(start, step):
    ...     while True:
    ...         yield start
    ...         start += step
    >>> a = sequence(2, 3) # 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, ...
    >>> b = sequence(3, 2) # 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, ...
    >>> result = merge(a, b) # 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15
    >>> [next(result) for _ in range(10)]
    [2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15]
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"

```

Use Ok to test your code:

```
python3 ok -q merge
```

  

### Q3: Yield Paths

Define a generator function `yield_paths` which takes in a tree `t`, a value `value`, and returns a generator object which yields each path from the root of `t` to a node that has label `value`.

Each path should be represented as a list of the labels along that path in the tree. You may yield the paths in any order.

```
def yield_paths(t, value):
    """Q4: Yields all possible paths from the root of t to a node with the label
    value as a list.

    >>> t1 = tree(1, [tree(2, [tree(3), tree(4, [tree(6)]), tree(5)]), tree(5)])
    >>> print_tree(t1)
    1
      2
        3
        4
          6
        5
      5
    >>> next(yield_paths(t1, 6))
    [1, 2, 4, 6]
    >>> path_to_5 = yield_paths(t1, 5)
    >>> sorted(list(path_to_5))
    [[1, 2, 5], [1, 5]]

    >>> t2 = tree(0, [tree(2, [t1])])
    >>> print_tree(t2)
    0
      2
        1
          2
            3
            4
              6
            5
          5
    >>> path_to_2 = yield_paths(t2, 2)
    >>> sorted(list(path_to_2))
    [[0, 2], [0, 2, 1, 2]]
    """
    if label(t) == value:
        yield ____
    for b in branches(t):
        for ____ in ____:
            yield ____

```

> _Hint:_ If you're having trouble getting started, think about how you'd approach this problem if it wasn't a generator function. What would your recursive calls be? With a generator function, what happens if you make a "recursive call" within its body?

> _Hint:_ Try coming up with a few simple cases of your own! How should this function work when `t` is a leaf node?

> _Hint:_ Remember, it's possible to loop over generator objects because generators are iterators!

> Note: Remember that this problem should **yield paths** -- do not return a list of paths!

Use Ok to test your code:

```
python3 ok -q yield_paths
```
