> The output is art,  
> But what about its source code?  
> It's just as abstract.

Please vote for your favorite entry in this semester's CS 61A Scheme Art Contest. The winner should exemplify the principles of elegance, beauty, and abstraction that are prized in the Berkeley computer science curriculum. As an academic community, we should strive to recognize and reward merit and achievement (in other words, please don't just vote for your friends).

[Cast your vote by submitting this form](https://go.cs61a.org/scheme-art-voting). Voting is due **11:59 PM on Friday, 12/8**.
