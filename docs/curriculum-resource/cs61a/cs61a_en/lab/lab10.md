An interpreter is a program that allows you to interact with the computer using a specific language. It takes the code you write, interprets it, and then executes the corresponding actions, often using a more fundamental language to communicate with the computer hardware.

In Project 4, you'll develop an interpreter for the Scheme programming language using Python. Interestingly, the Python interpreter you've been using throughout this course is primarily written in the C programming language. At the lowest level, computers operate by interpreting machine code, which is a series of ones and zeros that instructs the computer on performing basic tasks such as arithmetic operations and data retrieval.

When we talk about an interpreter, there are two languages at work:

1.  **The language being interpreted:** For Project 4, this is the Scheme language.
2.  **The implementation language:** This is the language used to create the interpreter itself, which, for Project 4, will be Python.

**REPL**

A common feature of interpreters is the Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL), which processes user inputs in a cyclic fashion through three stages:

-   **Read:** The interpreter first reads the input string provided by the user. This input goes through a parsing process that involves two key steps:
    
    -   The _lexical analysis_ step breaks down the input string into tokens, which are the basic elements or "words" of the language you're interpreting. These tokens represent the smallest units of meaning within the input.
    -   The _syntactic analysis_ step takes the tokens from the previous step and organizes them into a data structure that the underlying language can understand. For our Scheme interpreter, we assemble the tokens into a `Pair` object (similar to a `Link`), to represent the structure of the original call expression.
        
        -   The first item in the `Pair` represents the operator of the call expression, while the subsequent elements are the operands or arguments upon which the operation will act. Note that these operands can also be call expressions themselves (nested expressions).  
            

Below is a summary of the read process for a Scheme expression input:

-   **Eval:** This step evaluates the expressions you've written in that programming language to obtain a value. It involves the following two functions:
    
    -   `eval` takes an expression and evaluates it based on the language's rules. When the expression is a call expression, `eval` uses the `apply` function to obtain the result. It will evaluate the operator and its operands in order. For example, in `(add 1 2)`, `eval` would identify `add` as the operator and `1` and `2` as the operands. It evaluates `add` to ensure it's a valid function and then evaluates `1` and `2` to ensure they're valid arguments.
    -   `apply` takes the evaluated operator (the function) and applies it to the evaluated operands (the arguments). Note that it's possible that, during this process, `apply` needs to evaluate more expressions (like those found within the function body). This is where `apply` may call back to `eval`, and thus these two stages are _mutually recursive_.
-   **Print:** Display the result of evaluating the user input.

Here's how all the pieces fit together:

## Calculator

An interpreter is a program that executes programs. Today, we will extend the interpreter for Calculator, a simple made-up language that is a subset of Scheme. This lab is like Project 4 in miniature.

The Calculator language includes only the four basic arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`. These operations can be nested and can take various numbers of arguments, just like in Scheme. A few examples of calculator expressions and their corresponding values are shown below.

```
 calc> (+ 2 2 2)
 6

 calc> (- 5)
 -5

 calc> (* (+ 1 2) (+ 2 3 4))
 27
```

Calculator expressions are represented as Python objects:

-   Numbers are represented using Python numbers.
-   The symbols for arithmetic operations are represented using Python strings (e.g. `'+'`).
-   Call expressions are represented using the `Pair` class below.

## Pair Class

To represent Scheme lists in Python, we will use the `Pair` class (in both this lab and the Scheme project). A `Pair` instance has two attributes: `first` and `rest`. `Pair` is always called on two arguments. To make a list, nest calls to `Pair` and pass in `nil` as the second argument of the last pair.

-   Look familiar? `Pair` is very similar to `Link`, the class we used to represent linked lists. They differ in their `str` representation: printing a `Pair` instance displays the list using Scheme syntax.

> **Note** In the Python code, `nil` is bound to a user-defined object that represents an empty Scheme list. Similarly, `nil` in Scheme evaluates to an empty list.

For example, once our interpreter reads in the Scheme expression `(+ 2 3)`, it is represented as `Pair('+', Pair(2, Pair(3, nil)))`.

```
>>> p = Pair('+', Pair(2, Pair(3, nil)))
>>> p.first
'+'
>>> p.rest
Pair(2, Pair(3, nil))
>>> p.rest.first
2
>>> print(p)
(+ 2 3)
```

The `Pair` class has a `map` method that takes a one-argument python function `fn`. It returns the Scheme list that results from applying `fn` to each element of the Scheme list.

```
>>> p.rest.map(lambda x: 2 * x)
Pair(4, Pair(6, nil))
```

  

Here is the `Pair` class and `nil` object (`__str__` and `__repr__` methods not shown).

```
class Pair:
    """Represents the built-in pair data structure in Scheme."""
    def __init__(self, first, rest):
        self.first = first
        self.rest = rest

    def map(self, fn):
        """Return a Scheme list after mapping Python function FN to SELF."""
        mapped = fn(self.first)
        if self.rest is nil or isinstance(self.rest, Pair):
            return Pair(mapped, self.rest.map(fn))
        else:
            raise TypeError('ill-formed list')
```

```
class nil:
    """The empty list"""

    def map(self, fn):
        return self

nil = nil() # Assignment hides the nil class; there is only one instance
```

  

### Q1: Using Pair

Answer the following questions about a `Pair` instance representing the Calculator expression `(+ (- 2 4) 6 8)`.

Use Ok to test your understanding:

```
python3 ok -q using_pair -u
```

  

## Calculator Evaluation

For Question 2 (New Procedure) and Question 4 (Saving Values), you'll need to update the `calc_eval` function below, which evaluates a Calculator expression. For Question 2, you'll determine what are the `operator` and `operands` for a call expression in Scheme as well as how to apply a procedure to arguments the `calc_apply` line. For Question 4, you'll determine how to look up the value of symbols previously defined.

```
def calc_eval(exp):
    """
    >>> calc_eval(Pair("define", Pair("a", Pair(1, nil))))
    'a'
    >>> calc_eval("a")
    1
    >>> calc_eval(Pair("+", Pair(1, Pair(2, nil))))
    3
    """
    if isinstance(exp, Pair):
        operator = ____________ # UPDATE THIS FOR Q2
        operands = ____________ # UPDATE THIS FOR Q2
        if operator == 'and': # and expressions
            return eval_and(operands)
        elif operator == 'define': # define expressions
            return eval_define(operands)
        else: # Call expressions
            return calc_apply(___________, ___________) # UPDATE THIS FOR Q2
    elif exp in OPERATORS:   # Looking up procedures
        return OPERATORS[exp]
    elif isinstance(exp, int) or isinstance(exp, bool):   # Numbers and booleans
        return exp
    elif _________________: # CHANGE THIS CONDITION FOR Q4
        return _________________ # UPDATE THIS FOR Q4

```

### Q2: New Procedure

Add the `//` operation to Calculator, a floor-division procedure such that `(// dividend divisor)` returns the result of dividing `dividend` by `divisor`, ignoring the remainder (`dividend // divisor` in Python). Handle multiple inputs as illustrated in the following example: `(// dividend divisor1 divisor2 divisor3)` evaluates to `(((dividend // divisor1) // divisor2) // divisor3)` in Python. Assume every call to `//` has at least two arguments.

> _Hint:_ You will need to modify both the `calc_eval` and `floor_div` methods for this question!

```
calc> (// 1 1)
1
calc> (// 5 2)
2
calc> (// 28 (+ 1 1) 1)
14
```

> _Hint:_ Make sure that every element in a `Pair` (the operator and all operands) will be `calc_eval`\-uated once, so that we can correctly apply the relevant Python operator to operands! You may find the `map` method of the `Pair` class useful for this.

```
def floor_div(args):
    """
    >>> floor_div(Pair(100, Pair(10, nil)))
    10
    >>> floor_div(Pair(5, Pair(3, nil)))
    1
    >>> floor_div(Pair(1, Pair(1, nil)))
    1
    >>> floor_div(Pair(5, Pair(2, nil)))
    2
    >>> floor_div(Pair(23, Pair(2, Pair(5, nil))))
    2
    >>> calc_eval(Pair("//", Pair(4, Pair(2, nil))))
    2
    >>> calc_eval(Pair("//", Pair(100, Pair(2, Pair(2, Pair(2, Pair(2, Pair(2, nil))))))))
    3
    >>> calc_eval(Pair("//", Pair(100, Pair(Pair("+", Pair(2, Pair(3, nil))), nil))))
    20
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"

```

Use Ok to test your code:

```
python3 ok -q floor_div
```

  

### Q3: New Form

Add `and` expressions to our Calculator interpreter as well as introduce the Scheme boolean values `#t` and `#f`, represented as Python `True` and `False`. (The examples below assumes conditional operators (e.g. `<`, `>`, `=`, etc) have already been implemented, but you do not have to worry about them for this question.)

```
calc> (and (= 1 1) 3)
3
calc> (and (+ 1 0) (< 1 0) (/ 1 0))
#f
calc> (and #f (+ 1 0))
#f
calc> (and 0 1 (+ 5 1)) ; 0 is a true value in Scheme!
6
```

In a call expression, we first evaluate the operator, then evaluate the operands, and finally apply the procedure to its arguments (just like you did for `floor_div` in the previous question). However, since `and` is a special form that short circuits on the first false argument, we cannot evaluate `and` expressions the same way we evaluate call expressions. We need to add special logic for forms that don't always evaluate all the sub-expressions.

> **Important**: To check whether some `val` is a false value in Scheme, use `val is scheme_f` rather than `val == scheme_f`.

```
scheme_t = True   # Scheme's #t
scheme_f = False  # Scheme's #f

def eval_and(expressions):
    """
    >>> calc_eval(Pair("and", Pair(1, nil)))
    1
    >>> calc_eval(Pair("and", Pair(False, Pair("1", nil))))
    False
    >>> calc_eval(Pair("and", Pair(1, Pair(Pair("//", Pair(5, Pair(2, nil))), nil))))
    2
    >>> calc_eval(Pair("and", Pair(Pair('+', Pair(1, Pair(1, nil))), Pair(3, nil))))
    3
    >>> calc_eval(Pair("and", Pair(Pair('-', Pair(1, Pair(0, nil))), Pair(Pair('/', Pair(5, Pair(2, nil))), nil))))
    2.5
    >>> calc_eval(Pair("and", Pair(0, Pair(1, nil))))
    1
    >>> calc_eval(Pair("and", nil))
    True
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"

```

Use Ok to test your code:

```
python3 ok -q eval_and
```

  

### Q4: Saving Values

Implement a `define` special form that binds values to symbols. This should work like `define` in Scheme: `(define <symbol> <expression>)` first evaluates the `expression`, then binds the `symbol` to its value. The whole `define` expression evaluates to the `symbol`.

```
calc> (define a 1)
a
calc> a
1
```

This is a more involved change. Here are the 4 steps involved:

1.  Add a `bindings` dictionary that will store the symbols and correspondings values (done for you).
2.  Identify when the define form is given to `calc_eval` (done for you).
3.  Allow symbols bound to values to be looked up in `calc_eval`.
4.  Write the function `eval_define` which should add symbols and values to the bindings dictionary.

```
bindings = {}

def eval_define(expressions):
    """
    >>> eval_define(Pair("a", Pair(1, nil)))
    'a'
    >>> eval_define(Pair("b", Pair(3, nil)))
    'b'
    >>> eval_define(Pair("c", Pair("a", nil)))
    'c'
    >>> calc_eval("c")
    1
    >>> calc_eval(Pair("define", Pair("d", Pair("//", nil))))
    'd'
    >>> calc_eval(Pair("d", Pair(4, Pair(2, nil))))
    2
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"

```

Use Ok to test your code:

```
python3 ok -q eval_define
```
