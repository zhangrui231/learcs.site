# Lab 4: Tree Recursion, Data Abstraction

_Due by 11:59pm on Wednesday, February 21._

## Starter Files

Download [lab04.zip](/resource/cs61a/lab/lab04.zip). Inside the archive, you will find starter files for the questions in this lab, along with a copy of the [Ok](https://cs61a.org/lab/lab04/ok) autograder.

## Required Questions

## Dictionaries

Consult the drop-down if you need a refresher on dictionaries. It's okay to skip directly to the questions and refer back here should you get stuck.

A dictionary contains key-value pairs and allows the values to be looked up by their key using square brackets. Each key must be unique.

```
>>> d = {2: 4, 'two': ['four'], (1, 1): 4}
>>> d[2]
4
>>> d['two']
['four']
>>> d[(1, 1)]
4
```

The sequence of keys or values or key-value pairs can be accessed using `.keys()` or `.values()` or `.items()`.

```
>>> for k in d.keys():
...     print(k)
...
2
two
(1, 1)
>>> for v in d.values():
...     print(v)
...
4
['four']
4
>>> for k, v in d.items():
...     print(k, v)
...
2 4
two ['four']
(1, 1) 4
```

You can check whether a dictionary contains a key using `in`:

```
>>> 'two' in d
True
>>> 4 in d
False
```

A dictionary comprehension is an expression that evaluates to a new dictionary.

```
>>> {3*x: 3*x + 1 for x in range(2, 5)}
{6: 7, 9: 10, 12: 13}
```

  

### Q1: Dictionaries

> Use Ok to test your knowledge with the following "What Would Python Display?" questions:
> 
> ```
> python3 ok -q pokemon -u
> ```
> 
>   

```
>>> pokemon = {'pikachu': 25, 'dragonair': 148, 'mew': 151}
>>> pokemon['pikachu']
______25
>>> len(pokemon)
______3
>>> 'mewtwo' in pokemon
______False
>>> 'pikachu' in pokemon
______True
>>> 25 in pokemon
______False
>>> 148 in pokemon.values()
______True
>>> 151 in pokemon.keys()
______False
>>> 'mew' in pokemon.keys()
______True
```

### Q2: Divide

Implement `divide`, which takes two lists of positive integers `quotients` and `divisors`. It returns a dictionary whose keys are the elements of `quotients`. For each key `q`, its corresponding value is a list of all the elements of `divisors` that can be evenly divided by `q`.

> Hint: The value for each key needs be a list, so list comprehension might be useful here.

```
def divide(quotients, divisors):
    """Return a dictonary in which each quotient q is a key for the list of
    divisors that it divides evenly.

    >>> divide([3, 4, 5], [8, 9, 10, 11, 12])
    {3: [9, 12], 4: [8, 12], 5: [10]}
    >>> divide(range(1, 5), range(20, 25))
    {1: [20, 21, 22, 23, 24], 2: [20, 22, 24], 3: [21, 24], 4: [20, 24]}
    """
    return {____: ____ for ____ in ____}

```

Use Ok to test your code:

```
python3 ok -q divide
```

  

### Q3: Buying Fruit

Implement `buy`, which takes a list of `required_fruits` (strings), a dictionary `prices` (strings for key, positive integers for value), and a `total_amount` (integer). It prints all the ways to buy some of each required fruit so that the total price equals `total_amount`. You must include at least one of every fruit in `required_fruit` and cannot include any other fruits that are not in `required_fruit`.

> The `display` function will be helpful. You can call `display` on a `fruit` and its `count` to create a string containing both.
> 
> What does `fruits` and `amount` represent? How are they used in the recursive?

```
def buy(required_fruits, prices, total_amount):
    """Print ways to buy some of each fruit so that the sum of prices is amount.

    >>> prices = {'oranges': 4, 'apples': 3, 'bananas': 2, 'kiwis': 9}
    >>> buy(['apples', 'oranges', 'bananas'], prices, 12)
    [2 apples][1 orange][1 banana]
    >>> buy(['apples', 'oranges', 'bananas'], prices, 16)
    [2 apples][1 orange][3 bananas]
    [2 apples][2 oranges][1 banana]
    >>> buy(['apples', 'kiwis'], prices, 36)
    [3 apples][3 kiwis]
    [6 apples][2 kiwis]
    [9 apples][1 kiwi]
    """
    def add(fruits, amount, cart):
        if fruits == [] and amount == 0:
            print(cart)
        elif fruits and amount > 0:
            fruit = fruits[0]
            price = ____
            for k in ____:
                add(____, ____, ____)
    add(required_fruits, total_amount, '')

def display(fruit, count):
    """Display a count of a fruit in square brackets.

    >>> display('apples', 3)
    '[3 apples]'
    >>> display('apples', 1)
    '[1 apple]'
    """
    assert count >= 1 and fruit[-1] == 's'
    if count == 1:
        fruit = fruit[:-1]  # get rid of the plural s
    return '[' + str(count) + ' ' + fruit + ']'
```

Use Ok to test your code:

```
python3 ok -q buy
```

  

## Data Abstraction

Consult the drop-down if you need a refresher on data abstraction. It's okay to skip directly to the questions and refer back here should you get stuck.

A _data abstraction_ is a set of functions that compose and decompose compound values. One function called the _constructor_ puts together two or more parts into a whole (such as a rational number; also known as a fraction), and other functions called _selectors_ return parts of that whole (such as the numerator or denominator).

```
def rational(n, d):
    "Return a fraction n / d for integers n and d."

def numer(r):
    "Return the numerator of rational number r."

def denom(r):
    "Return the denominator of rational number r."
```

Crucially, one can use a data abstraction without knowing how these functions are implemented. For example, we (humans) can verify that `mul_rationals` is implemented correctly just by knowing what `rational`, `numer`, and `denom` do without knowing how they are implemented.

```
def mul_rationals(r1, r2):
    "Return the rational number r1 * r2."
    return rational(numer(r1) * numer(r2), denom(r1) * denom(r2))
```

However, for Python to run the program, the data abstraction requires an implementation. Using knowledge of the implementation crosses the abstraction barrier, which separates the part of a program that depends on the implementation of the data abstraction from the part that does not. A well-written program typically will minimize the amount of code that depends on the implementation so that the implementation can be changed later on without requiring much code to be rewritten.

When using a data abstraction that has been provided, write your program so that it will still be correct even if the implementation of the data abstraction changes.

### Cities

Say we have a data abstraction for cities. A city has a name, a latitude coordinate, and a longitude coordinate.

Our data abstraction has one **constructor**:

-   `make_city(name, lat, lon)`: Creates a city object with the given name, latitude, and longitude.

We also have the following **selectors** in order to get the information for each city:

-   `get_name(city)`: Returns the city's name
-   `get_lat(city)`: Returns the city's latitude
-   `get_lon(city)`: Returns the city's longitude

Here is how we would use the constructor and selectors to create cities and extract their information:

```
>>> berkeley = make_city('Berkeley', 122, 37)
>>> get_name(berkeley)
'Berkeley'
>>> get_lat(berkeley)
122
>>> new_york = make_city('New York City', 74, 40)
>>> get_lon(new_york)
40
```

All of the selector and constructor functions can be found in the lab file if you are curious to see how they are implemented. However, the point of data abstraction is that, when writing a program about cities, we do not need to know the implementation.

### Q4: Distance

We will now implement the function `distance`, which computes the distance between two city objects. Recall that the distance between two coordinate pairs `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` can be found by calculating the `sqrt` of `(x1 - x2)**2 + (y1 - y2)**2`. We have already imported `sqrt` for your convenience. Use the latitude and longitude of a city as its coordinates; you'll need to use the selectors to access this info!

```
from math import sqrt
def distance(city_a, city_b):
    """
    >>> city_a = make_city('city_a', 0, 1)
    >>> city_b = make_city('city_b', 0, 2)
    >>> distance(city_a, city_b)
    1.0
    >>> city_c = make_city('city_c', 6.5, 12)
    >>> city_d = make_city('city_d', 2.5, 15)
    >>> distance(city_c, city_d)
    5.0
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"

```

Use Ok to test your code:

```
python3 ok -q distance
```

  

### Q5: Closer City

Next, implement `closer_city`, a function that takes a latitude, longitude, and two cities, and returns the _name_ of the city that is closer to the provided latitude and longitude.

You may only use the selectors and constructors introduced above and the `distance` function you just defined for this question.

> **Hint**: How can you use your `distance` function to find the distance between the given location and each of the given cities?

```
def closer_city(lat, lon, city_a, city_b):
    """
    Returns the name of either city_a or city_b, whichever is closest to
    coordinate (lat, lon). If the two cities are the same distance away
    from the coordinate, consider city_b to be the closer city.

    >>> berkeley = make_city('Berkeley', 37.87, 112.26)
    >>> stanford = make_city('Stanford', 34.05, 118.25)
    >>> closer_city(38.33, 121.44, berkeley, stanford)
    'Stanford'
    >>> bucharest = make_city('Bucharest', 44.43, 26.10)
    >>> vienna = make_city('Vienna', 48.20, 16.37)
    >>> closer_city(41.29, 174.78, bucharest, vienna)
    'Bucharest'
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"

```

Use Ok to test your code:

```
python3 ok -q closer_city
```

  

### Q6: Don't violate the abstraction barrier!

> Note: this question has no code-writing component (if you implemented the previous two questions correctly).

When writing functions that use a data abstraction, we should use the constructor(s) and selector(s) whenever possible instead of assuming the data abstraction's implementation. Relying on a data abstraction's underlying implementation is known as _violating the abstraction barrier_.

It's possible that you passed the doctests for the previous questions even if you violated the abstraction barrier. To check whether or not you did so, run the following command:

Use Ok to test your code:

```
python3 ok -q check_city_abstraction
```

The `check_city_abstraction` function exists only for the doctest, which swaps out the implementations of the original abstraction with something else, runs the tests from the previous two parts, then restores the original abstraction.

The nature of the abstraction barrier guarantees that changing the implementation of an data abstraction shouldn't affect the functionality of any programs that use that data abstraction, as long as the constructors and selectors were used properly.

If you passed the Ok tests for the previous questions but not this one, the fix is simple! Just replace any code that violates the abstraction barrier with the appropriate constructor or selector.

Make sure that your functions pass the tests with both the first and the second implementations of the data abstraction and that you understand why they should work for both before moving on.
