## Homework 9: Programs as Data, Macros

-   [hw09.zip](/resource/cs61a/hw/hw09.zip)

_Due by 11:59pm on Thursday, April 25_

## Instructions

Download [hw09.zip](/resource/cs61a/hw/hw09.zip). Inside the archive, you will find a file called [hw09.scm](https://cs61a.org//hw/hw09/hw09.scm), along with a copy of the `ok` autograder.

**Submission:** When you are done, submit the assignment by uploading all code files you've edited to Gradescope. You may submit more than once before the deadline; only the final submission will be scored. Check that you have successfully submitted your code on Gradescope. See [Lab 0](https://cs61a.org/lab/lab00#task-c-submitting-the-assignment) for more instructions on submitting assignments.

**Using Ok:** If you have any questions about using Ok, please refer to [this guide.](https://cs61a.org/articles/using-ok)

**Readings:** You might find the following references useful:

-   [Scheme Specification](https://cs61a.org/articles/scheme-spec/)
-   [Scheme Built-in Procedure Reference](https://cs61a.org/articles/scheme-builtins/)

**Grading:** Homework is graded based on correctness. Each incorrect problem will decrease the total score by one point. **This homework is out of 2 points.**

The 61A Scheme interpreter is included in each Scheme assignment. To start it, type `python3 scheme` in a terminal. To load a Scheme file called `f.scm`, type `python3 scheme -i f.scm`. To exit the Scheme interpreter, type `(exit)`.

### Scheme Editor

All Scheme assignments include a web-based editor that makes it easy to run ok tests and visualize environments. Type `python3 editor` in a terminal, and the editor will open in a browser window (at `http://127.0.0.1:31415/`). To stop running the editor and return to the command line, type `Ctrl-C` in the terminal where you started the editor.

The `Run` button loads the current assignment's `.scm` file and opens a Scheme interpreter, allowing you to try evaluating different Scheme expressions.

The `Test` button runs all ok tests for the assignment. Click `View Case` for a failed test, then click `Debug` to step through its evaluation.

### Recommended VS Code Extensions

If you choose to use VS Code as your text editor (instead of the web-based editor), install the [vscode-scheme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sjhuangx.vscode-scheme) extension so that parentheses are highlighted.

Before:

After:

In addition, the 61a-bot ([installation instructions](https://cs61a.org/articles/61a-bot)) VS Code extension is available for Scheme homeworks. The bot is also integrated into `ok`.

## Programs as Data: Chef Curry

Recall that currying transforms a multiple argument function into a series of higher-order, one argument functions. In the next set of questions, you will be creating functions that can automatically curry a function of any length using the notion that programs are data!

### Q1: Cooking Curry

Implement the function `curry-cook`, which takes in a Scheme list `formals` and a quoted expression `body`. `curry-cook` should generate a program as a list which is a curried version of a lambda function. The outputted program should be a curried version of a lambda function with formal arguments equal to `formals`, and a function body equal to `body`. You may assume that all functions passed in will have more than 0 `formals`; otherwise, it would not be curry-able!

For example, if you wanted to curry the function `(lambda (x y) (+ x y))`, you would set `formals` equal to `'(x y)`, the `body` equal to `'(+ x y)`, and make a call to `curry-cook`: `(curry-cook '(x y) '(+ x y))`.

```
scm> (curry-cook '(a) 'a)
(lambda (a) a)
scm> (curry-cook '(x y) '(+ x y))
(lambda (x) (lambda (y) (+ x y)))
```

```
(define (curry-cook formals body)
    'YOUR-CODE-HERE
)
```

Use Ok to test your code:

```
python3 ok -q curry-cook
```

  

### Q2: Consuming Curry

Implement the function `curry-consume`, which takes in a curried lambda function `curry` and applies the function to a list of arguments `args`. You may make the following assumptions:

1.  If `curry` is an `n`\-curried function, then there will be at most `n` arguments in `args`.
2.  **If there are 0 arguments** (`args` is an empty list), then you may assume that `curry` has been fully applied with relevant arguments; in this case, `curry` now contains a value representing the output of the lambda function. Return it.

Note that there can be fewer `args` than `formals` for the corresponding lambda function `curry`! In the case that there are fewer arguments, `curry-consume` should return a curried lambda function, which is the result of partially applying `curry` up to the number of `args` provdied. See the doctests below for a few examples.

```
scm> (define three-curry (lambda (x) (lambda (y) (lambda (z) (+ x (* y z)))) ))
three-curry
scm> (define eat-two (curry-consume three-curry '(1 2))) ; pass in only two arguments, return should be a one-arg lambda function!
eat-two
scm> eat-two
(lambda (z) (+ x (* y z)))
scm> (eat-two 3) ; pass in the last argument; 1 + (2 * 3)
7
scm> (curry-consume three-curry '(1 2 3)) ; all three arguments at once
7
```

```
(define (curry-consume curry args)
    'YOUR-CODE-HERE
)
```

Use Ok to test your code:

```
python3 ok -q curry-consume
```

  

## Macros

### Q3: Switch to Cond

`switch` is a macro that takes in an expression `expr` and a list of pairs, `options`, where the first element of each pair is some value and the second element is a single expression. `switch` evaluates the expression contained in the list of `options` that corresponds to the value that `expr` evaluates to.

```
scm> (switch (+ 1 1) ((1 (print 'a))
                      (2 (print 'b)) ; (print 'b) is evaluated because (+ 1 1) evaluates to 2
                      (3 (print 'c))))
b
```

`switch` uses another procedure called `switch-to-cond` in its implementation:

```
scm> (define-macro (switch expr options)
                   (switch-to-cond (list 'switch expr options))
     )
```

Your task is to define `switch-to-cond`, which is a procedure (not a macro) that takes a quoted `switch` expression and converts it into a `cond` expression with the same behavior. An example is shown below.

```
scm> (switch-to-cond `(switch (+ 1 1) ((1 2) (2 4) (3 6))))
(cond ((equal? (+ 1 1) 1) 2) ((equal? (+ 1 1) 2) 4) ((equal? (+ 1 1) 3) 6))
```

```
(define-macro (switch expr options) (switch-to-cond (list 'switch expr options)))

(define (switch-to-cond switch-expr)
  (cons _________
    (map
	  (lambda (option) (cons _______________ (cdr option)))
	  (car (cdr (cdr switch-expr))))))
```

Use Ok to test your code:

```
python3 ok -q switch-to-cond
```

  

## Check Your Score Locally
