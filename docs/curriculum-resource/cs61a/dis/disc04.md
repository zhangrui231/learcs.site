## Discussion 4: Tree Recursion

-   [disc04.pdf](/resource/cs61a/disc/disc04.pdf)

Pick someone in your group to [join Discord](https://cs61a.org/articles/discord). It's fine if multiple people join, but one is enough.

Now switch to Pensieve:

-   **Everyone**: Go to [discuss.pensieve.co](http://discuss.pensieve.co/) and log in with your @berkeley.edu email, then enter your group number. (Your group number is the number of your Discord channel.)

Once you're on Pensieve, you don't need to return to this page; Pensieve has all the same content (but more features). If for some reason Penseive doesn't work, return to this page and continue with the discussion.

Post in the `#help` channel on [Discord](https://cs61a.org/articles/discord/) if you have trouble.

## Getting Started

Say your name and your favorite tree (a particular tree or a kind of tree) in honor of today's topic: tree recursion. (Tree recursive functions are functions that call themselves more than once.)

In this discussion, don't use a Python interpreter to run code until you are confident your solution is correct. Figure things out and check your work by _thinking_ about what your code will do. Not sure? Talk to your group!

**\[New\]** If you have fewer than 4 people in your group, you can merge with another group in the room with you.

**\[New\]** Recursion takes practice. Please don't get discouraged if you're struggling to write recursive functions. Instead, every time you do solve one (even with help or in a group), make note of what you had to realize to make progress. Students improve through practice and reflection.

**\[For Fun\]** This emoticon of a guy in a cowboy hat is valid Python: `o[:-D]`

```
>>> o = [2, 0, 2, 4]
>>> [ o[:-D] for D in range(1,4) ]
[[2, 0, 2], [2, 0], [2]]
```

## Tree Recursion

For the following questions, don't start trying to write code right away. Instead, start by describing the recursive case in words. Some examples:

-   In `fib` from lecture, the recursive case is to add together the previous two Fibonacci numbers.
-   In `double_eights` from lab, the recursive case is to check for double eights in the rest of the number.
-   In `count_partitions` from lecture, the recursive case is to partition `n-m` using parts up to size `m` **and** to partition `n` using parts up to size `m-1`.

### Q1: Insect Combinatorics

An insect is inside an `m` by `n` grid. The insect starts at the bottom-left corner `(1, 1)` and wants to end up at the top-right corner `(m, n)`. The insect can only move up or to the right. Write a function `paths` that takes the height and width of a grid and returns the number of paths the insect can take from the start to the end. (There is a [closed-form solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-form_expression) to this problem, but try to answer it with recursion.)

![Insect grids.](/img/cs61a/grid.jpg)

In the `2` by `2` grid, the insect has two paths from the start to the end. In the `3` by `3` grid, the insect has six paths (only three are shown above).

> **Hint:** What happens if the insect hits the upper or rightmost edge of the grid?
```python
def paths(m, n):
    """Return the number of paths from one corner of an
    M by N grid to the opposite corner.

    >>> paths(2, 2)
    2
    >>> paths(5, 7)
    210
    >>> paths(117, 1)
    1
    >>> paths(1, 157)
    1
    """

```

**Presentation Time:** Once your group has converged on a solution, it's time to practice your ability to describe why your recursive case is correct. Pick a presenter, then send a message to the discuss-queue channel with the @discuss tag, your discussion group number, and the message "Here's the path!" and a member of the course staff will join your voice channel to hear your description and give feedback.

## Tree Recursion with Lists

**\[New\]** Some of you already know list operations that we haven't covered yet, such as `append`. Don't use those today. All you need are list literals (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`), item selection (e.g., `s[0]`), list addition (e.g., `[1] + [2, 3]`), `len` (e.g., `len(s)`), and slicing (e.g., `s[1:]`). Use those! There will be plenty of time for other list operations when we introduce them next week.

The most important thing to remember about lists is that a non-empty list `s` can be split into its first element `s[0]` and the rest of the list `s[1:]`.

```
>>> s = [2, 3, 6, 4]
>>> s[0]
2
>>> s[1:]
[3, 6, 4]
```

### Q2: Max Product

Implement `max_product`, which takes a list of numbers and returns the maximum product that can be formed by multiplying together non-consecutive elements of the list. Assume that all numbers in the input list are greater than or equal to 1.
```python
def max_product(s):
    """Return the maximum product of non-consecutive elements of s.

    >>> max_product([10, 3, 1, 9, 2])   # 10 * 9
    90
    >>> max_product([5, 10, 5, 10, 5])  # 5 * 5 * 5
    125
    >>> max_product([])                 # The product of no numbers is 1
    1
    """
```
Run in 61A Code
:::tip[**Hint**]
First try multiplying the first element by the `max_product` of everything after the first two elements (skipping the second element because it is consecutive with the first), then try skipping the first element and finding the `max_product` of the rest. To find which of these options is better, use `max`.

A great way to get help is to talk to the course staff!

### Q3: Sum Fun

Implement `sums(n, m)`, which takes a total `n` and maximum `m`. It returns a list of all lists:

1.  that sum to `n`,
2.  that contain only positive numbers up to `m`, and
3.  in which no two adjacent numbers are the same.

Two lists with the same numbers in a different order should both be returned.

Here's a recursive approach that matches the template below: build up the `result` list by building all lists that sum to `n` and start with `k`, for each `k` from 1 to `m`. For example, the result of `sums(5, 3)` is made up of three lists:

-   `[[1, 3, 1]]` starts with 1,
-   `[[2, 1, 2], [2, 3]]` start with 2, and
-   `[[3, 2]]` starts with 3.

**Hint:** Use `[k] + s` for a number `k` and list `s` to build a list that starts with `k` and then has all the elements of `s`.

```
>>> k = 2
>>> s = [4, 3, 1]
>>> [k] + s
[2, 4, 3, 1]
```
```python
def sums(n, m):
    """Return lists that sum to n containing positive numbers up to m that
    have no adjacent repeats.

    >>> sums(5, 1)
    []
    >>> sums(5, 2)
    [[2, 1, 2]]
    >>> sums(5, 3)
    [[1, 3, 1], [2, 1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 2]]
    >>> sums(5, 5)
    [[1, 3, 1], [1, 4], [2, 1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 2], [4, 1], [5]]
    >>> sums(6, 3)
    [[1, 2, 1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 2, 1], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1]]
    """
    if n < 0:
        return []
    if n == 0:
        sums_to_zero = []     # The only way to sum to zero using positives
        return [sums_to_zero] # Return a list of all the ways to sum to zero
    result = []
    for k in range(1, m + 1):
        result = result + [ ___ for rest in ___ if rest == [] or ___ ]
    return result
```
Run in 61A Code
:::tip[**Hint**]
`k` is the first number in a list that sums to `n`, and `rest` is the rest of that list, so build a list that sums to `n`.

Call `sums` to build all of the lists that sum to `n-k` so that they can be used to construct lists that sum to `n` by putting a `k` on the front.

Here is where you ensure that "no two adjacent numbers are the same." Since `k` will be the first number in the list you're building, it must not be equal to the first element of `rest` (which will be the second number in the list you're building).
