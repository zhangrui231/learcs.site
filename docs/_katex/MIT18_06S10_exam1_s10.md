1. Forward elimination changes $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ to a row reduced $R\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{d}$: the complete solution is


$$

\mathbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix} 4 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} + c_1 \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} + c_2 \begin{bmatrix} 5 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}

$$


(a) (14 points) What is the 3 by 3 reduced row echelon matrix $R$ and what is $\mathbf{d}$?

(b) (10 points) If the process of elimination subtracted 3 times row 1 from row 2 and then 5 times row 1 from row 3, what matrix connects $R$ and $\mathbf{d}$ to the original $A$ and $\mathbf{b}$? Use this matrix to find $A$ and $\mathbf{b}$.

2. Suppose $A$ is the matrix


$$
 A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 & 2 & 2 \\
0 & 3 & 8 & 7 \\
0 & 0 & 4 & 2
\end{bmatrix}. 
$$


(a) (16 points) Find all special solutions to $Ax = 0$ and describe in words the whole nullspace of $A$.

(b) (10 points) Describe the column space of this particular matrix $A$. "All combinations of the four columns" is not a sufficient answer.

(c) (10 points) What is the reduced row echelon form $R^* = \text{rref}(B)$ when $B$ is the 6 by 8 block matrix


$$
 B = \begin{bmatrix}
A & A \\
A & A
\end{bmatrix} 
$$
 using the same $A$?

3. (16 points) Circle the words that correctly complete the following sentence:

(a) Suppose a 3 by 5 matrix $A$ has rank $r = 3$. Then the equation $Ax = b$

( always / sometimes but not always )

has ( a unique solution / many solutions / no solution ).

(b) What is the column space of $A$? Describe the nullspace of $A$.

4. Suppose that $A$ is the matrix


$$
 A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 6 & 5 \\ 2 & 4 \end{bmatrix}. 
$$


(a) (10 points) Explain in words how knowing all solutions to $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ decides if a given vector $\mathbf{b}$ is in the column space of $A$.

(b) (14 points) Is the vector $\mathbf{b} = \begin{bmatrix} 8 \\ 28 \\ 14 \end{bmatrix}$ in the column space of $A$?
